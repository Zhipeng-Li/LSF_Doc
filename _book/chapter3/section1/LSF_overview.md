**[Introduction to IBM Spectrum LSF](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_foundations/lsf_introduction_to.html?view=kc)**
The IBM Spectrum LSF ("LSF", short for load sharing facility) software is industry-leading enterprise-class software. LSF distributes work across existing heterogeneous IT resources to create a shared, scalable, and fault-tolerant infrastructure, that delivers faster, more reliable workload performance and reduces cost. LSF balances load and allocates resources, and provides access to those resources.
