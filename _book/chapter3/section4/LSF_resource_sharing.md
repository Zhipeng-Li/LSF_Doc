# LSF 资源共享

LSF resources can be shared by defining an EGO resource distribution plan. LSF requests resources from the EGO resource manager. Based on the values specified in the resource distribution plan, the resource manager returns the number of available slots (m) and the names of the hosts on which the slots reside.
