高效的集群管理系统\n计算机通过执行程序，帮助科研人员进行科学研究。通常，计算机的使用者不关心程序的执行过程，他们只希望更快更有效地获取运算结果。而为了提供强大的计算能力，大量的计算资源以集群的形式出现。集群系统的使用和有效管理都面临着挑战。\nLSF（Load Sharing Facility）是一款分布式集群管理系统软件，负责计算资源的管理和批处理作业的调度。它给用户提供统一的集群资源访问接口，让用户透明地访问整个集群资源。同时提供了丰富的功能和可定制的策略。LSF 具有良好的可伸缩性和高可用性，支持几乎所有的主流操作系统。它通常是高性能计算环境中不可或缺的基础软件。\nLSF 虽然是一款商业软件，但它同时也提供免费的社区版供大家下载和使用。\n简单的使用\nLSF 的使用者可以大约分为两类，普通用户和集群系统管理员。普通用户可以通过命令，将计算程序提交给集群执行，获取计算结果。系统管理员可以通过配置文件和管理命令，管理集群以及统计计算资源的使用情况。\n图 1. LSF 结构图\n\n普通用户提交可执行程序或脚本给 LSF。LSF 将已提交的程序称为作业。作业在LSF 的队列 (Queue) 里排队 (PEND) ，等待调度。\n清单 1.  提交作业\nlsfrhel01 # bsub –R \"linux\" sleep 1000\nJob  is submitted to default queue .\nlsfrhel01 # bjobs\nJOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME\n1       tom     PEND  normal     lsfrhel01               *eep 1000  May  9 15:42\n\nLSF 根据配置的调度策略，把作业分配到最合适的计算节点上执行 (RUN) 。用户可以通过命令行查看，控制作业的执行过程。除此之外，LSF 还为用户提供了作业修改，需求描述，作业控制等多种命令行工具。\n清单 2. 查看运行作业\nlsfrhel01 # bjobs\nJOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME\n1       tom     RUN   normal     lsfrhel01   lsfrhel02   *eep 1000  May  9 15:42\n\n系统管理员通常需要了解整个集群系统中作业和资源的使用状况，LSF 提供的命令帮助管理员快速直观地看到系统概况：系统中队列的状态，机器的状态，作业的资源使用概况，等等。除此之外，LSF 还为管理员提供了丰富的集群配置，控制，管理等功能。\n清单 3. 查看 LSF 系统信息\nlsfrhel01 # bqueues normal\nQUEUE_NAME      PRIO STATUS          MAX JL/U JL/P JL/H NJOBS  PEND   RUN  SUSP\nnormal           30  Open:Active       -    -

Host）。它们既可以提交作业，也可以执行作业。按照职能的不同，服务节点可以有不同的身份。管理作业调度资源的节点称为主节点（Master host），一个集群只有一个主节点。对于一次作业提交来说，提交作业的节点为提交节点（Submission host），被分配并执行作业的节点是执行节点（Execution host）。\n图 2. 节点角色\n\n为了便于机器的管理，LSF 提供节点组（Host group）的概念。任意的机器集合可以被作为整体命名，通过名字在集群范围内整体引用。一种典型的用法是将节点按照内存大小进行分类：大内存节点组和小内存节点组。不同的作业可以请求不同的节点组，LSF 按照请求，分配该节点组中的机器来执行作业。节点组还有一个灵活的特性：为方便管理，同一台机器可以定义到不同的节点组。\n图 3. 节点分组\n\n作业占用机器资源进行计算。每一个机器被划分成若干个槽位（slot） 。每一个槽位通常可以容纳一个作业运行。 通常情况下，每一个槽位和一个CPU 核心（core）相对应。槽位是一个容易混淆的概念，为便于理解，可以将槽位等同于CPU 核心来看待。对于并行作业来说，比如MPI 作业，每一个都需要占用更多的槽位加速计算。\n作业的管理是以队列（Queue）为单位的，调度的策略也是按照队列定制的。作为作业的容器，可以配置多个队列定制不同策略。LSF 按照队列的优先级，从高到低调度每一个队列中的作业，为其分配资源。高优先级队列的作业对资源的使用具有优先权。\n图 4. 调度方式\n\n　　\n人是作业提交者，也是资源的真正使用者。对于资源和作业的管理，不少策略都是以用户为单位。为了更好管理用户，LSF 引入用户组（user group）。若干用户集合可以统一命名，并使用该命名统一引用。例如，一个人属于一个部门，一个部门可以作为一个用户组，这种情况下就可以使用部门名字命名和引用。\n体系结构\nLSF 采用传统的客户机服务器模式，主节点负责整个集群的管理，从节点负责管理运行其上的作业的管理。每一个服务节点包含三个后台进程：\n\nSbatchd\n\n批处理作业管理进程。负责在本节点上执行作业，监控作业状态以及收集其使用的资源。同时根据用户请求或者系统策略触发，控制作业的状态，比如发送SIGSTOP 给作业、挂起作业运行等。\n\nRES\n\n远程执行服务进程。负责执行远程客户请求的任务，主要用于并行作业的远程任务启动、监控以及控制。\n\nLIM\n\n采集本节点的负载信息进程。将收集到的资源负载信息周期上报给主节点上的LIM。主节点的LIM 拥有整个集群资源状态，为其它服务提供集群系统范围内的资源当前快照。\n主管理节点在这个基础上，包括两个额外的进程：\n\nMbatchd\n\n集群管理服务进程。它是LSF 的中心：通过主节点的LIM 获取机器以及相关资源信息，处理远程用户的作业提交请求，委托mbschd 将作业调度到相关资源上，发送调度结果到指定机器，并通过和sbatchd 的交互，监控作业使用的资源，控制作业的执行过程。\n\nMbschd\n\n调度策略服务进程。从mbachd 获取作业和资源信息，根据定制策略，为mbatchd 提供作业调度服务。\n图 5. 体系结构\n\n当一个新作业提交的时候，集群管理服务进程检查作业的合法性，并将作业放入到指定的队列中等待调度。经过调度的作业，将获得执行机器上的slot、内存等资源。LSF 负责保留相关资源并将作业指派到已分配机器上执行。作业的状态和实际使用的资源通过批处理作业管理进程报告给集群管理进程。\n集群系统构建在分布式网络节点上，节点的失效和网路设备的故障都会导致集群系统的基础环境改变。集群系统的高可用性功能可以保证即使在底层设备故障，LSF 系统仍然可以提供可靠稳定的服务。LSF 采用主备模式实现系统的故障恢复。LSF 的主节点将运行时事件信息写入网络文件系统。当主节点失效后，相关备节点进行选举，选出新的主节点。新的主节点从事件信息文件中恢复作业信息、机器状态，最终获取集群控制权，恢复LSF 状态。\n为了更进一步扩展LSF 的资源管理范围和方式，在单一集群基础上，LSF 还提供多集群互联技术（Multi-Cluster）。多集群通过互联，共享跨集群资源，提供更强大的计算能力。下面是一种典型的多集群架构，集群1负责接收作业提交和转发，集群 2 和 集群3 负责作业执行。\n图 6. 多集群结构\n\n资源调度\nLSF 收集每一个节点的处理器、内存、交换区、临时存储区等资源信息。主节点掌握全局资源信息。资源的管理和调度以这些信息为基础。\n清单 4.

603M\n\n作业在使用资源的时候，主要考虑三个方面：如何根据作业的资源描述选择合适的执行机器，如何预留机器资源减少运行时的资源竞争，以及如何限制作业对资源的使用避免作业过度消耗资源。\n首先是选择执行机。每一个作业会有不同的资源需求。可以通过 LSF 定义的资源描述模式请求资源，运行节点由LSF根据作业对资源描述来匹配。当一个作业需要一定量内存的时候，\"select[mem>512]\" 表示选择内存大于512M 的机器来运行作业。调度器为其选择拥有合适资源的机器。\n其次是确保执行机上的资源分配。既然我们选择了大内存的机器，那么别人的作业也可以选择大内存的机器。如果很多作业都在大内存机器上运行，资源竞争会导致内存短缺，作业最终无法占用到请求的资源。为了更好的确保资源，我们需要在作业运行时保留这些资源不会再分配给别人的作业。\"rusage[mem=512]\" 表示保留 512M                内存给作业，节点当前可用内存将会有 512M 分配给该作业，节点可分配资源将减少512M 的内存。通过 LSF                的策略，可用内存的分配得到控制，已经保留的内存将不会再分配给其它的作业。\n最后是保证资源不被过度消耗。资源的保留是通过LSF 的策略保证，但是作业的进程在运行时，却尚未受LSF                控制。我们需要在执行执行节点上，对作业的系统资源设置限制，保证作业（进程）本身不会吃掉过多的内存。通常我们可以设置一个资源上限，防止作业过度消耗资源。比如，内存限制 '1024M'，防止作业使用超过1G                的内存。\n清单 5. 提交内存需求的作业\n$ bsub -M 1024 -R \"select[mem>512] rusage[mem=512]\" sleep

还支持很多种资源，比如 CPU、交换区、临时目录大小等等。虽然这些默认管理的资源始终是有限的，但是 LSF 还提供了资源管理的扩展机制。用户可以统过编写自己的 ELIM 来收集自定义的资源。比如，收集系统的网络带宽以及网络负载，作业可以通过资源描述，选择拥有相应带宽的节点执行作业。资源的种类很多，LSF 提供布尔类型、字符串类型和数字类型来描述多种多样的资源。\n定制策略\nLSF 提供了非常丰富的调度策略供LSF系统管理员选择配置。策略针对作业和资源，从提高资源利用率、优化资源分配、提高用户满意度等各个方面为资源的使用者和管理者提供可配置策略。\n默认的策略是先来先服务（FCFS）。顾名思义，先提交的作业先调度，优先获得资源。排在后面的作业必须等待前面的作业运行完成才能开始。后提交作业可能在很长时间得不到机会运行。考虑到资源分配的公平问题，比如部门之间应该平等使用资源，公平共享（Fairshare）策略得以引入。通过配置以部门为单位的用户组平等分享资源，不同用户的作业优先考虑资源所有权。避免了先来先服务导致的资源不平等，从而优化资源分配。\n公平共享是从资源分配公平性上考虑问题的，它达到的是一个最终资源使用公平的平衡。但是在使用过程中，如果其他人或者部门没有作业，那么整个集群的资源将会被分配给目前已经提交的作业。作业执行期间，即便新的作业拥有更多的资源优先使用权，也要等待其他作业执行完毕，释放资源后才能执行。这样在短时期内资源使用是不公平的。对于拥有资源使用权却无法执行的情况，资源保障（Resource Guarantee）策略可以为用户保留资源，随时可用。这是在牺牲资源利用率基础上提高用户满意度。\n对于并行作业，通常要求很多的slot，当系统资源紧张的时候，即使等待很久依然无法运行。当系统释放一个slot                的时候，这个作业因为发现资源不够，便放弃对资源的优先权。排在后面的只需要一个 slot 的作业将获取资源执行。这个过程反复着，并行作业始终无法获取足够资源。为了解决这个问题引入了资源保留策略。虽然当前资源不够运行的，但是这个资源暂时被并行作业占有，等待后面不断释放的资源，直到 slot 满足作业的需求。\n但是长时间的等待还是会浪费这些空闲资源，因此又加入回填策略。在不影响并行作业启动时间的前提下，可以将短作业优先调度到已经被保留的slot 上。\n对于特权或者紧急的用户或者应用，当系统资源完全使用的时候。为了尽快执行，抢占（Preemption）策略可以通过抢占已执行作业的资源，执行自己的作业。\n除此之外，为了满足用户需求，LSF 提供了资源预留（Advanced Reservation）、SLA 等等。为了提高资源利用率，LSF 提供了NUMA绑定（Affinity）策略等等。对于详尽的策略，可以参考LSF 管理员手册。LSF 的很多策略都可以自由组合，通过管理员的配置，最终形成丰富的，满足各种需求的定制策略。\n即便所有的策略都不能满足你的要求，LSF 的调度策略还实现了插件机制。新的扩展可以通过LSF 提供的API 实现新的策略。\n总结\n在高性能计算领域，作业管理系统是一种成熟的系统软件技术。LSF 作为其中的佼佼者，提供了统一的访问接口，丰富的调度策略，灵活的配置和部署。LSF 的体系结构和部署方式让它可以有效管理一定规模的集群系统，目前商业版可以支持多达数千台节点和数百万作业的管理。LSF 的故障恢复机制足以保证集群系统的高可用性。在分布式计算技术不断发展的今天，作为传统的批处理管理软件，依然发挥着重要的作用。\n参考资源\n\n下载 IBM Spectrum LSF Community Edition，安装，试用LSF 的基本功能\n参考 IBM Spectrum

可以容许集群中，任何主机或主机组的故障。当某主机不可用时，在该主机上运行的所有作业，将会重新排队运行或丢失，具体取决于该作业是否被标记为可重新运行。其他挂起或正在运行的作业，则不会受到影响。\n故障转移的工作原理\n容错能力取决于事件日志文件 lsb.events，该文件保存在主文件服务器上。系统中的每个事件都记录在该文件中，包括所有作业提交以及作业和主机状态更改。如果主节点不可用，则从主节点候选列表中选择一个新的主节点，新的主节点上的 sbatchd 守护程序，将启动一个新的 mbatchd 守护程序。 新的 mbatchd 守护程序，会读取lsb.events 文件以恢复系统状态。\n重复事件记录\nFor sites not wanting to rely solely on a central file server for recovery information, LSF can be configured to maintain a duplicate event log by keeping a replica of the lsb.events file. The replica is stored on the file server, and used if the primary copy is unavailable. When duplicate event logging is enabled, the primary event log is stored locally on the first master host, and resynchronized with the replicated copy when the host recovers.\n主机故障转移\nThe LSF master host is chosen dynamically. If the current master host becomes unavailable, another host takes over automatically. The failover master host is selected from the list that is defined in the LSF_MASTER_LIST parameter in the lsf.conf file (specified in the install.config file at installation). The first available host in the list acts as the master.\nRunning jobs are managed by the sbatchd daemon on each server host. When the new mbatchd daemon starts, it polls the sbatchd daemon on each host and finds the status of its jobs. If the sbatchd daemon fails but the host is still running, jobsthat are running on the host are not lost. When the sbatchd daemon is restarted, it regains control of all jobs that are running on the host.\n作业故障转移\nJobs can be submitted as rerunnable, so that they automatically run again from the beginning or as checkpointable, so that they start again from a checkpoint on another host if they are lost because of a host failure.\nIf all of the hosts in a cluster go down, all running jobs are lost. When a master candidate host comes back up and takes over as master, it reads the lsb.events file to get the state of all batch jobs. Jobs that were running when the systems went down are assumed to be exited unless they were marked as rerunnable, and email is sent to the submitting user. Pending jobs remain in their queues, and are scheduled as hosts become available.\n分区集群\nIf the cluster is partitioned by a network failure, a master LIM takes over on each side of the partition while a master host candidate is available on each side of the partition. Interactive load-sharing remains available while each host still has access to the LSF executable files.\n分区网络\nIf the network is partitioned, only one of the partitions can access the lsb.events file, so LSF services are only available on one side of the partition. A lock file is used to make sure that only one mbatchd daemon runs in the cluster.\n作业异常处理\nYou can configure hosts and queues so that LSF detects exceptional conditions while jobs are running, and takes appropriate action automatically. You can customize what exceptions are detected and the corresponding actions. For example, you can set LSF to restart a job automatically if it exits with a specific error code. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 11:00:51\n"},"chapter3/section2/security.html":{"url":"chapter3/section2/security.html","title":"安全","keywords":"","body":"安全\n了解 LSF 安全模型，身份验证和用户角色。\nLSF 安全模型\n\n默认情况下，LSF 安全模型在内部跟踪用户帐户。 LSF 中定义的用户帐户，包括用于提供身份验证的密码和用于提供授权的已分配角色，例如管理员。\nLSF 用户角色\n没有启用EGO的 LSF 支持以下用户角色：\n\nLSF 用户\n有权将作业提交到 LSF 集群，并查看作业和群集的状态。\n\nLSF 主要管理员\n有权执行集群范围的操作，更改配置文件，重新配置集群以及控制所有用户提交的作业。lsb.params 和lsb.hosts 等配置文件，可配置 LSF 的各个方面。\n\nLSF 管理员\n有权执行影响其他LSF用户的操作。集群管理员可以对集群中的所有作业和队列，执行管理操作。可能没有更改 LSF 配置文件的权限。\n队列管理员的管理权限仅限于指定的队列。\n主机组的管理员管理权限仅限于指定的主机组。\n用户组的管理员管理权限仅限于指定的用户组。\n\n\n启用 EGO 的 LSF 用户角色\n启用 EGO 的 LSF，支持以下角色：\n\n集群管理员\n可以管理集群中的任何对象和工作负载。\n\n消费者管理员\n可以管理他们有权访问的使用者中的任何对象和工作负载。\n\n消费者用户\n可以在他们有权访问的使用者中运行工作负载。\n\n\n用户帐户是在 EGO 中创建和管理的。 EGO 从其用户数据库授权用户。\nLSF 用户组\n在可以指定 LSF 用户组的任何位置上，指定 UNIX 或 Linux 用户组，以此来直接使用任何现有的 UNIX 和 Linux 用户组。\n外部认证\nLSF 为倾向于使用外部或第三方安全机制（例如 Kerberos，LDAP 或 ActiveDirectory）的站点，提供了一个安全插件。\n您可以创建自定义的 eauth 可执行文件，以提供用户，主机和守护程序的外部身份验证。 凭证是从外部安全系统传递的。还可以通过自定义的 eauth 可执行文件，来从操作系统或从诸如 Kerberos 的身份验证协议获取凭据。 \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 10:45:35\n"},"chapter3/section3/inside_workload_management.html":{"url":"chapter3/section3/inside_workload_management.html","title":"3.3 作业负载管理","keywords":"","body":"3.3 作业负载管理\n了解 LSF 作业生命周期。 使用 bsub 将作业提交到队列，并指定作业提交选项以修改默认作业行为。 提交的作业在队列中等待，直到将它们调度并分配到主机上来执行。 在作业分发时，LSF会检查哪些主机有资格运行该作业。\n\n作业生命周期\nLSF 作业会经历几种状态，从作业提交开始，到分发，执行和最终返回作业结果。\n\n作业提交\n使用 bsub 命令在命令行上提交作业。 您可以使用 bsub 命令指定许多选项来修改默认行为。 作业必须提交到队列中。\n\n作业调度和分配\n提交的作业在队列中等待，直到将它们调度并分配到主机上来执行。\n\n主机选择\n每次 LSF 尝试分派作业时，它都会检查哪些主机有资格运行该作业。\n\n作业执行环境\n当 LSF 运行作业时，它将环境从提交主机，复制到执行主机。 \n\n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 11:09:58\n"},"chapter3/section3/job_lifecycle.html":{"url":"chapter3/section3/job_lifecycle.html","title":"作业生命周期","keywords":"","body":"作业生命周期\nAn LSF job goes through several states, starting with job submission, through dispatch, execution, and return of job results.\n\n1. Submit a job\nYou submit a job from an LSF client or server with the bsub command.\nIf you do not specify a queue when you submit a job, the job is submitted to the default queue.\nJobs are held in a queue while they wait to be scheduled. Waiting jobs have the PEND state.

Unlike the job ID, the job name is not necessarily unique.\n\n\n2. Schedule the job\n\nThe master batch daemon (mbatchd) looks at jobs in the queue and sends the jobs for scheduling to the master batch scheduler daemon (mbschd).

Jobs must be submitted to a queue.\nYou can also use the IBM Platform Application Center to submit jobs.\nQueues\nQueues represent a set of pending jobs, lined up in a defined order and waiting for their opportunity to use resources. Queues implement different job scheduling and control policies.\nQueues have the following attributes:\n\nPriority\nName\nQueue limits (restrictions on hosts, number of jobs, users, groups, or processors)\nStandard UNIX and Linux limits (memory, swap, process, CPU)\nScheduling policies\nAdministrators\nRun conditions\nLoad-sharing threshold conditions\nUNIX nice value (sets the UNIX and Linux scheduler priority)\n\nQueue priority\nDefines the order in which queues are searched to determine which job will be processed. Queues are assigned a priority by the LSF administrator, where a higher number has a higher priority. Queues are serviced by LSF in order of priority from the highest to the lowest. If multiple queues have the same priority, LSF schedules all the jobs from these queues in first-come, first-served order.\nAutomatic queue selection\nWhen you submit a job, LSF considers the requirements of the job and automatically chooses a suitable queue from a list of candidate default queues.\nLSF selects a suitable queue according to the following constraints:\n\nUser access restriction\nQueues that do not allow this user to submit jobs are not considered.\n\nHost restriction\nIf the job explicitly specifies a list of hosts on which the job can be run, then the selected queue must be configured to send jobs to hosts in the list.\n\nQueue status\nClosed queues are not considered.\n\nExclusive execution restriction\nIf the job requires exclusive execution, then queues that are not configured to accept exclusive jobs are not considered.\n\nJob’s requested resources\nResources that the job requests must be within the resource allocation limits of the selected queue.\n\n\nIf multiple queues satisfy the above requirements, then the first queue that is listed in the candidate queues that satisfies the requirements is selected. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 11:10:24\n"},"chapter3/section3/job_scheduling_and_dispatch.html":{"url":"chapter3/section3/job_scheduling_and_dispatch.html","title":"作业调度","keywords":"","body":"作业调度\nSubmitted jobs wait in queues until they are scheduled and dispatched to a host for execution.\nWhen a job is submitted to LSF, many factors control when and where the job starts to run:\n\nActive time window of the queue or hosts\nResource requirements of the job\nAvailability of eligible hosts\nVarious job slot limits\nJob dependency conditions\nFairshare constraints (configured user share policies)\nLoad conditions\n\nScheduling policies\nTo solve diverse problems, LSF allows multiple scheduling policies in the same cluster. LSF has several queue scheduling policies such as exclusive, preemptive, fairshare, and hierarchical fairshare.\n\nFirst-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling: By default, jobs in a queue are dispatched in FCFS order. This means that jobs are dispatched according to their order in the queue.\nService level agreement (SLA) scheduling: An SLA in LSF is a “just-in-time” scheduling policy that schedules the services agreed to between LSF administrators and LSF users. The SLA scheduling policy defines how many jobs should be run from each SLA to meet the configured goals.\nFairshare scheduling: If you specify a fairshare scheduling policy for the queue or if host partitions have been configured, LSF dispatches jobs between users based on assigned user shares, resource usage, or other factors.\nPreemption: You can specify desired behavior so that when two or more jobs compete for the same resources, one job preempts the other. Preemption can apply to not only job slots, but also to advance reservation (reserving hosts for particular jobs) and licenses (using IBM Platform License Scheduler).\nBackfill: Allows small jobs to run on job slots reserved for other jobs, provided the backfilling job completes before the reservation time expires and resource usage is due.\n\nScheduling and dispatch\nJobs are scheduled at regular intervals (5 seconds by default). Once jobs are scheduled, they can be immediately dispatched to hosts.\nTo prevent overloading any host, by default LSF waits a short time between dispatching jobs to the same host.\nDispatch order\nJobs are not necessarily dispatched in order of submission.\nEach queue has a priority number set by the LSF administrator when the queue is defined. LSF tries to start jobs from the highest priority queue first.\nLSF considers jobs for dispatch in the following order:\n\nFor each queue, from highest to lowest priority. If multiple queues have the same priority, LSF schedules all the jobs from these queues in first-come, first-served (FCFS) order.\nFor each job in the queue, according to FCFS order.\nIf any host is eligible to run this job, start the job on the best eligible host, and mark that host ineligible to start any other job until the period specified byt the JOB_ACCEPT_INTERVAL parameter has passed. \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 11:10:09\n"},"chapter3/section3/host_selection.html":{"url":"chapter3/section3/host_selection.html","title":"节点选择","keywords":"","body":"节点选择\nEach time LSF attempts to dispatch a job, it checks to see which hosts are eligible to run the job.\nA number of conditions determine whether a host is eligible:\n\nHost dispatch windows\nResource requirements of the job\nResource requirements of the queue\nHost list of the queue\nHost load levels\nJob slot limits of the host\nUser quota and user limits\n\nA host is only eligible to run a job if all the conditions are met.

EGO manages the supply of resources, making them available to applications.\nHosts can be divided into two groups: management hosts and compute hosts. Management hosts provide specialized services to the cluster, while compute hosts run user workload.\nManagement hosts\nManagement hosts provide both cluster and workload management services within the cluster, and are not expected to run workload for users. The master host, all master candidate hosts, and session manager hosts must be management hosts. Other management hosts include the host running the data loaders and data purger for the reporting feature.\nManagement hosts all run on the same operating system: all Windows, all UNIX, or all Linux.\n\nMaster host\nThe master host is the first host installed in the cluster. The resource manager (vemkd) for the cluster resides on this host. The master host controls the rest of the hosts in the cluster and is the interface to the clients of the cluster.\n\nMaster candidates\nThere is only one master host at a time. If the master host should fail, another host automatically takes over the master host role. Hosts that can act as the master are called master candidates.\n\nSession manager host\nOne or more management hosts run session managers. There is one session manager per available slot on a management host. There is one session manager per application.\n\n\nCompute hosts\nCompute hosts are those hosts in the cluster that provide computing resources to consumers. A cluster may contain any number of compute hosts, but must have at least one compute host.\n\nCPU slots\nA CPU slot is the unit used to measure compute resources.

For example, a compute host has the attributes of memory, CPU utilization, operating system type.\nResource groups\nResources can be grouped into logical groups to simplify identification, resource allocation, or for administration and monitoring purposes. These resource groups are used to provide a consumer with a like group of hosts to run workload. Any host in a resource group can be able to run the same workload.\nThe following figure shows two resource groups:\n\nManagementHosts\nComputeHosts\n\n\nIf all of your hosts are identical, these resource groups might suffice.

Resources might come and go from the system, so EGO supports dynamic membership in a resource group.

Multiprocessor hosts are used to run parallel jobs. A multiprocessor host with a single process queue is considered a single machine. A box full of processors that each have their own process queue is treated as a group of separate machines.\nTip\nThe names of your hosts should be unique. They cannot be the same as the cluster name or any queue that is defined for the cluster.\nJob\nAn LSF job is a unit of work that runs in the LSF system.\nA job is a command that is submitted to LSF for execution, by using the bsub command. LSF schedules, controls, and tracks the job according to configured policies.\nJobs can be complex problems, simulation scenarios, extensive calculations, anything that needs compute power.\nJob files\nWhen a job is submitted to a queue, LSF holds it in a job file until conditions are right for it run. Then, the job file is used to run the job.\nOn UNIX, the job file is a Bourne shell script that is run at execution time.\nOn Windows, the job file is a batch file that is processed at execution time.\nInteractive batch job\nAn interactive batch job is a batch job that allows you to interact with the application and still take advantage of LSFscheduling policies and fault tolerance.\nAll input and output are through the terminal that you used to type the job submission command.\nWhen you submit an interactive job, a message is displayed while the job is awaiting scheduling. A new job cannot be submitted until the interactive job is completed or terminated.\nInteractive task\nAn interactive task is a command that is not submitted to a batch queue and scheduled by LSF, but is dispatched immediately.\nLSF locates the resources that are needed by the task and chooses the best host among the candidate hosts that has the required resources and is lightly loaded. Each command can be a single process, or it can be a group of cooperating processes.\nTasks are run without using the batch processing features of LSF but still with the advantage of resource requirements and selection of the best host to run the task based on load.\nLocal task\nA local task is an application or command that does not make sense to run remotely.\nFor example, the ls command on UNIX.\nRemote task\nA remote task is an application or command that that can be run on another machine in the cluster.\nHost types and host models\nHosts in LSF are characterized by host type and host model.\nThe following example is a host with type X86_64, with host models Opteron240, Opteron840, Intel_EM64T, and so on.\n\nHost type\nAn LSF host type is the combination of operating system and host CPU architecture.\nAll computers that run the same operating system on the same computer architecture are of the same type. These hosts are binary-compatible with each other.\nEach host type usually requires a different set of LSF binary files.\nHost model\nAn LSF host model is the host type of the computer, which determines the CPU speed scaling factor that is applied in load and placement calculations.\nThe CPU factor is considered when jobs are being dispatched.\nResources\nLSF resources are objects in the LSF system resources that LSF uses track job requirements and schedule jobs according to their availability on individual hosts.\nResource usage\nThe LSF system uses built-in and configured resources to track resource availability and usage. Jobs are scheduled according to the resources available on individual hosts.\nJobs that are submitted through the LSF system will have the resources that they use monitored while they are running. This information is used to enforce resource limits and load thresholds as well as fairshare scheduling.\nLSF collects the following kinds of information:\n\nTotal CPU time that is consumed by all processes in the job\nTotal resident memory usage in KB of all currently running processes in a job\nTotal virtual memory usage in KB of all currently running processes in a job\nCurrently active process group ID in a job\nCurrently active processes in a job\n\nOn UNIX and Linux, job-level resource usage is collected through PIM.\nLoad indices\nLoad indices measure the availability of dynamic, non-shared resources on hosts in the cluster. Load indices that are built into the LIM are updated at fixed time intervals.\nExternal load indices\nDefined and configured by the LSF administrator and collected by an External Load Information Manager (ELIM) program. The ELIM also updates LIM when new values are received.\nStatic resources\nBuilt-in resources that represent host information that does not change over time, such as the maximum RAM available to user processes or the number of processors in a machine. Most static resources are determined by the LIM at start-up time.\nStatic resources can be used to select appropriate hosts for particular jobs that are based on binary architecture, relative CPU speed, and system configuration.\nLoad thresholds\nTwo types of load thresholds can be configured by your LSF administrator to schedule jobs in queues. Each load threshold specifies a load index value:\n\nThe loadSched load threshold determines the load condition for dispatching pending jobs. If a host’s load is beyond any defined loadSched, a job cannot be started on the host. This threshold is also used as the condition for resuming suspended jobs.\nThe loadStop load threshold determines when running jobs can be suspended.\n\nTo schedule a job on a host, the load levels on that host must satisfy both the thresholds that are configured for that host and the thresholds for the queue from which the job is being dispatched.\nThe value of a load index might either increase or decrease with load, depending on the meaning of the specific load index. Therefore, when you compare the host load conditions with the threshold values, you need to use either greater than (>) or less than (\nRuntime resource usage limits\nLimit the use of resources while a job is running. Jobs that consume more than the specified amount of a resource are signaled.\nHard and soft limits\nResource limits that are specified at the queue level are hard limits while limits that are specified with job submission are soft limits. See the setrlimit man page for information about hard and soft limits.\nResource allocation limits\nRestrict the amount of a resource that must be available during job scheduling for different classes of jobs to start, and which resource consumers the limits apply to. If all of the resource is consumed, no more jobs can be started until some of the resource is released.\nResource requirements (bsub -R)\nThe bsub -R option specifies resources requirements for the job. Resource requirements restrict which hosts the job can run on. Hosts that match the resource requirements are the candidate hosts. When LSF schedules a job, it collects the load index values of all the candidate hosts and compares them to the scheduling conditions. Jobs are only dispatched to a host if all load values are within the scheduling thresholds. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-08 09:01:31\n"},"chapter4/section1/cluster_characteristics.html":{"url":"chapter4/section1/cluster_characteristics.html","title":"集群特征","keywords":"","body":"集群特征\nFind the name of your cluster after installation, cluster administrators, and where hosts are defined.\nCluster name and administrators\nYour cluster is installed according to the installation options specified by the lsfinstall -f install.configcommand and the options you chose in the install.config file.

Using %J helps you find job output when you run a lot of jobs.\nInteractive batch jobs with bsub -I\nTo submit an interactive job through LSF, use the -I option:\nThe following command submits a batch interactive job that displays the output of the ls command:\n% bsub -I ls\nTo submit a batch interactive job by using a pseudo-terminal, use the bsub -Ip option.\nTo submit a batch interactive job and create a pseudo-terminal with shell mode support, use the bsub -Is option. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 21:31:55\n"},"chapter4/section2/subsection3/Display job status.html":{"url":"chapter4/section2/subsection3/Display job status.html","title":"Display job status","keywords":"","body":"Display job status\nUse the bjobs command to see the job ID and other information about your jobs.\nThe status of each LSF job is updated periodically.\n% bjobs\nJOBID USER      STAT  QUEUE     FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME    SUBMIT_TIME\n1266  user1     RUN   normal    hosta       hostb       sleep 60    Jun 5 17:39:58\nThe job that is named sleep 60 runs for 60 seconds.

A wrapper script is an executable file for launching your application through LSF. It gives users a simple interface to run their jobs that is easy to deploy and maintain.\nFor example, if your application is called abc, rename abc to abc_real and create a wrapper script that is called abc:\n#! /bin/sh\nbsub -R \"rusage[abc_license=1:duration=1]\" abc_real\nWhen users run abc, they are actually running a script to submit a job abc_real to LSF that uses 1 shared resource named abc_license.\nFor more information about specifying shared resources by using the resource requirement (rusage) string on the -R option of the bsub command, see Manage software licenses and other shared resources.\nBy adding appropriate options to the script, you can enhance your integration:\n\nRequeue jobs based on license availability\nCopy input and output files to and from the local directory on the execution host\nCalculate and estimate resource requirements\n\nWrapper binary programs\nA wrapper binary is similar to a wrapper shell script in the form of a compiled binary executable. Compiled wrapper files usually run faster and more efficiently than shell scripts, and they also have access to the LSF API (LSLIB and LSBLIB). Binary code is also more secure because users cannot modify it without the source code and appropriate libraries, but it is more time consuming to develop wrapper binary programs than wrapper shell scripts.\nModifying existing application source code and interfaces\nLSF is already integrated closely with many commonly used software products. IBM and other software application vendors provide facilities and services for closer integration of LSF and other applications. By modifying existing application user interfaces, you can enable easy job submission, license maximization, parallel execution, and other advanced LSF features. In some cases, you are able to run an LSF job directly from the application user interface.\nWhere to go next\nLearn more about administering your cluster, described in Manage users, hosts, and queues. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 21:32:42\n"},"chapter4/section2/subsection4/manage_users_hosts_and_queues.html":{"url":"chapter4/section2/subsection4/manage_users_hosts_and_queues.html","title":"管理用户、节点与队列","keywords":"","body":"管理用户、节点与队列\nMake your cluster available to users with cshrc.lsf and profile.lsf.

LSF manages shared resources for host selection and batch or interactive job execution. These resources are dynamic resources because the load on the system changes with the availability of the resources.\nSoftware licenses as shared resources\nThe most common application of shared resources is to manage software application licenses. You submit jobs that require those licenses and LSF runs the jobs according to their priorities when licenses are available. When licenses are not available, LSF queues the jobs then dispatches them when licenses are free. Configuring application licenses as shared resources ensures optimal use of costly and critical resources.\nDefine dynamic shared resources in an ELIM\nFor LSF to use a shared resource like a software license, you must define the resource in the Resource section of the lsf.shared file. You define the type of resource and how often you want LSF to refresh the value of the resource.\nFor LSF to track the resources correctly over time, you must define them as external load indexes. LSF updates load indexes periodically with a program called an External Load Information Manager (ELIM).\nAn ELIM can be a shell script or a compiled binary program, which returns the values of the shared resources you define. The ELIM must be named elim and located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory:\n/usr/share/lsf/lsf/cluser1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/elim\nYou can find examples of sample ELIMs in the misc/examples directory.\nExample of shared licenses\nIn the lsf.shared file, define two dynamic shared resources for software licenses, named license1 and license2:\nBegin Resource\nRESOURCENAME  TYPE    INTERVAL INCREASING  RELEASE   DESCRIPTION   # Keywords\nlicense1      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license1 resource)\nlicense2      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license2 resource)\nEnd Resource\n\nThe\n\n  TYPE\n  parameter for a shared resource can be one of the following types:\n\nNumeric\nBoolean\nString\nIn this case, the resource is Numeric.\n\n\n\nThe INTERVAL parameter specifies how often you want the value to be refreshed. In this example, the ELIM updates the value of the shared resources license1 and license2 every 30 seconds.\n\nThe N in the INCREASING column means that the license resources are decreasing; that is, as more licenses become available, the load becomes lower.\n\nThe Y in the RELEASE column means that the license resources are released when a job that uses the license is suspended.\n\n\nMap dynamic shared resources to hosts\nTo make LSF aware of where the defined dynamic shared resources license1 and license2 you defined, map them to the hosts where they are located.\nIn the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.cluster.cluster_name file, configure a ResourceMap section to specify the mapping between shared resources license1 and license2 you defined in the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.shared file, and the hosts you want to map them to:\nBegin ResourceMap\nRESOURCENAME  LOCATION\nlicense1      [all]\nlicense1      [all]\nEnd ResourceMap\nIn this resource map, the [all] attribute under the LOCATION parameter means that resources license1 and license2 under the RESOURCENAME parameter are available on all hosts in the cluster. Only one ELIM needs to run on the master host because the two resources are the same for all hosts. If the location of the resources is different on different hosts, a different ELIM must run on every host.\nMonitor dynamic shared resources\nFor LSF to receive external load indexes correctly, the ELIM must send a count of the available resources to standard output in the following format:\nnumber_indexes [index_name index_value] ...\nThe fields in this example contain the following information:\n2 license1 3 license2 2\n\nThe total number of external load indexes (2)\nThe name of the first external load index (license1)\nThe value of the first load index (3)\nThe name of the second external load index (license2)\nThe value of the second load index (2)\n\nWrite the ELIM program\nThe ELIM must be an executable program, named elim, located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory.\nWhen the lim daemon is started or restarted, it runs the elim program on the same host and takes the standard output of the external load indexes that are sent by the elim program. In general, you can define any quantifiable resource as an external load index, write an ELIM to report its value, and use it as an LSF resource.\nThe following example ELIM program uses license1 and license2 and assumes that the FLEXlm license server controls them:\n#!/bin/sh \nNUMLIC=2           # number of dynamic shared resources\nwhile true\ndo\nTMPLICS='/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/lic -c \n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/license.dat -f license1, license2'\n\nLICS='echo $TMPLICS | sed -e s/-/_/g'\necho $NUMLIC $LICS # $NUMLIC is number of dynamic shared \nresource\nsleep 30           # Resource\ndone\nIn the script, the sed command changes the minus sign (-) to underscore (_) in the license feature names because LSF uses the minus sign for calculation, and it is not allowed in resource names.\nThe lic utility is available from IBM Support. You can also use the FLEXlm command lmstat to make your own ELIM.\nUse the dynamic shared resources\nTo enable the new shared resources in your cluster, restart LSF with the following commands:\n\nlsadmin reconfig\nbadmin reconfig\n\nIf no errors are found, use the lsload -l command to verify the value of your dynamic shared resources:\nHOST_NAME  status r15s  r1m  r15m  ut   pg   io  ls  it  tmp  swp  mem license1 license2\nhosta          ok  0.1  0.3  0.4   8%   0.2  50  73   0  62M  700M 425M       3        0 \nhostb          ok  0.1  0.1  0.4   4%   5.7   3   3   0  79M  204M  64M       3        0\nSubmit jobs that use shared resources\nTo submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource, use the command following command:\n% bsub -R 'rusage[license1=1:duration=1]' myjob\nIn the resource requirement (rusage) string, duration=1 means that license1 is reserved for 1 minute to give LSF time to check it out from FLEXlm.\nYou can also specify the resource requirement string at queue level, in the RES_REQ parameter for the queue. In the LSB_CONFDIR/cluster_name/configdir/lsb.queues file, specify the following resource requirement string:\nBegin Queue\nQUEUE_NAME = license1\nRES_REQ=rusage[license1=1:duration=1]\n...\nEnd Queue\nThen, submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource by using the following command:\n% bsub -q license1 myjob\nWhen licenses are available, LSF runs your jobs right away; when all licenses are in use, LSF puts your job in a queue and dispatches them as licenses become available. This way, all of your licenses are used to the best advantage.\nFor more information\n\nFor more information about the lsf.shared and lsf.cluster.cluster_name files and the parameters for configuring shared resources, see the Configuration Reference.\nFor more information about adding external resources to your cluster and configuring an ELIM to customize resources, see External load indices in Administering IBM Spectrum LSF. \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 21:35:50\n"},"chapter4/section3/troubleshooting_LSF_problems.html":{"url":"chapter4/section3/troubleshooting_LSF_problems.html","title":"4.3 LSF 排错","keywords":"","body":"4.3 LSF 排错\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 10:07:19\n"},"chapter4/section3/solving_common_LSF_problems.html":{"url":"chapter4/section3/solving_common_LSF_problems.html","title":"常见 LSF 问题","keywords":"","body":"常见 LSF 问题\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 10:07:19\n"},"chapter4/section3/LSF_error_messages.html":{"url":"chapter4/section3/LSF_error_messages.html","title":"LSF 错误信息","keywords":"","body":"LSF 错误信息\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 10:07:19\n"},"chapter5/run_jobs.html":{"url":"chapter5/run_jobs.html","title":"Chapter 5 作业调度管理","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5 作业调度管理\n运行，监视和控制提交给 LSF 的作业。\n\n关于IBM Spectrum LSF\n\n\n\n作业运行\n\n\n\n作业监控\n\n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-08 09:04:03\n"},"chapter5/section1/about_IBM_Spectrum_LSF.html":{"url":"chapter5/section1/about_IBM_Spectrum_LSF.html","title":"5.1 关于 IBM Spectrum LSF","keywords":"","body":"5.1 关于 IBM Spectrum LSF\n\nClusters, jobs, and queues\nThe IBM Spectrum LSF (\"LSF\", short for load sharing facility) software is industry-leading enterprise-class software that distributes work across existing heterogeneous IT resources to create a shared, scalable, and fault-tolerant infrastructure, that delivers faster, balanced, more reliable workload performance and reduces cost.\nHosts\nLSF daemons\nBatch jobs and tasks\nHost types and host models\nUsers and administrators\nResources\nJob lifecycle \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-08 09:27:32\n"},"chapter5/section1/LSF_clusters_jobs_and_queues.html":{"url":"chapter5/section1/LSF_clusters_jobs_and_queues.html","title":"LSF 集群，作业与队列","keywords":"","body":"LSF 集群，作业与队列\nThe IBM Spectrum LSF (\"LSF\", short for load sharing facility) software is industry-leading enterprise-class software that distributes work across existing heterogeneous IT resources to create a shared, scalable, and fault-tolerant infrastructure, that delivers faster, balanced, more reliable workload performance and reduces cost.\n \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-08 09:27:35\n"},"chapter5/section1/hosts.html":{"url":"chapter5/section1/hosts.html","title":"节点","keywords":"","body":"节点\nA host is an individual computer in the cluster.\nEach host may have more than one processor.

Unlike the job ID, the job name is not necessarily unique.\n2 Schedule job\n\nmbatchd looks at jobs in the queue and sends the jobs for scheduling to mbschd at a preset time interval (defined by the parameter JOB_SCHEDULING_INTERVAL in lsb.params).\nmbschd evaluates jobs and makes scheduling decisions based on the following:\nJob priority\nScheduling policies\nAvailable resources\n\n\nmbschd selects the best hosts where the job can run and sends its decisions back to mbatchd.\n\nResource information is collected at preset time intervals by the master LIM from LIMs on server hosts. The master LIM communicates this information to mbatchd, which in turn communicates it to mbschd to support scheduling decisions.\n3 Dispatch job\nAs soon as mbatchd receives scheduling decisions, it immediately dispatches the jobs to hosts.\n4 Run job\nsbatchd handles job execution. It does the following:\n\nReceives the request from mbatchd\nCreates a child sbatchd for the job\nCreates the execution environment\nStarts the job using res\n\nThe execution environment is copied from the submission host to the execution host and includes the following:\n\nEnvironment variables that are needed by the job\n\nWorking directory where the job begins running\n\nOther system-dependent environment settings; for example:\n\nOn UNIX and Linux, resource limits and umask\n\nOn Windows, desktop and Windows root directory\nThe job runs under the user account that submitted the job and has the status RUN.\n\n\n\n\n5 Return output\nWhen a job is completed, it is assigned the DONE status if the job was completed without any problems. The job is assigned the EXIT status if errors prevented the job from completing.\nsbatchd communicates job information including errors and output to mbatchd.\n6 Send email to client\nmbatchd returns the job output, job error, and job information to the submission host through email. Use the -o and -e options of bsub to send job output and errors to a file.\nJob report\nA job report is sent by email to the LSF client and includes the following information:\n\nJob information such as the following:\nCPU use\nMemory use\nName of the account that submitted the job\n\n\nJob output\nErrors \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-08 09:29:20\n"},"chapter5/section2/working_with_jobs.html":{"url":"chapter5/section2/working_with_jobs.html","title":"5.2 作业运行","keywords":"","body":"5.2 作业运行\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 10:07:19\n"},"chapter5/section2/submitting_jobs_using_bsub.html":{"url":"chapter5/section2/submitting_jobs_using_bsub.html","title":"Submitting jobs (bsub)","keywords":"","body":"Submitting jobs (bsub)\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 10:07:19\n"},"chapter5/section3/monitoring_jobs.html":{"url":"chapter5/section3/monitoring_jobs.html","title":"5.3 作业监控","keywords":"","body":"5.3 作业监控\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 10:07:19\n"},"chapter6/Administer_LSF.html":{"url":"chapter6/Administer_LSF.html","title":"Chapter 6 LSF 集群维护管理","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 6 LSF 集群维护管理\n了解如何管理 IBM Spectrum LSF 集群，如何控制守护程序，更改集群配置以及如何使用主机和队列。管理您的LSF 作业和作业调度策略。查看工作信息并控制工作。 了解如何为 LSF 作业配置和分配资源。 了解如何在 LSF 群集中提交，监视和控制高吞吐量和并行工作负载。 了解有关 LSF 错误和事件日志记录，以及 LSF 如何处理作业异常的信息。 调整 LSF 集群的性能和可伸缩性。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 集群管理要点\n了解如何管理 LSF 集群，控制守护程序，更改集群配置以及使用主机，队列和用户。\n\n监视 IBM Spectrum LSF 集群操作和运行状况\n了解如何监视集群性能，作业资源使用情况以及有关队列，作业和用户的其他信息。\n\n管理IBM Spectrum LSF作业执行\n了解如何管理 LSF 作业和作业调度策略。 查看作业信息，控制作业，并管理作业相关性，作业优先级，作业阵列，交互式作业，作业预处理和后处理，以及作业启动器。\n\n配置和共享IBM Spectrum LSF作业资源\n了解如何为 LSF 作业配置和分配资源。 在用户和项目之间公平地共享计算资源。 将资源分配限制应用于作业，管理主机和用户组，保留资源并指定作业的资源要求。\n\nGPU 资源\n了解如何为 LSF 作业配置和使用 GPU 资源。\n\n使用 LSF 配置容器\n为容器配置和使用 LSF 集成。\n\n管理 IBM Spectrum LSF 的高吞吐量工作负载\n了解如何在 LSF 集群中提交，监视和控制高吞吐量工作负载。 配置调度策略，以实现对短期作业的有效排队，调度和执行。\n\n管理 IBM Spectrum LSF 并行工作负载\n了解如何在 LSF 集群中提交，监视和控制并行工作负载。 配置保留资源的调度策略，以保证大型并行作业高效执行。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 安全性\n了解如何优化 LSF 集群的安全性。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 高级配置\n了解关于 LSF 错误和事件日志记录以及 LSF 如何处理作业异常的信息。 配置高级 LSF 功能。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 性能调优\n调整 LSF 集群的性能和可伸缩性。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 能源感知调度\n在大规模 LSF 安装中配置，管理和使用 IBM Spectrum LSF 能源感知调度功能，其中运行大型系统的能源需求，已成为这些系统总体成本的重要因素。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 多集群功能\n了解如何使用和管理 IBM Spectrum LSF 多集群功能，来实现跨 LSF 集群之间的资源共享。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 高级版\n配置和使用 IBM Spectrum LSF 高级版本（LSF Advanced Edition）。 学习使用专为具有高性能工作负载要求的大型集群，而设计的 LSF 的高级功能。\n\n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 09:11:45\n"},"chapter7/Reference.html":{"url":"chapter7/Reference.html","title":"Chapter 7 参考文档","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 7 参考\nLSF 命令和配置参数的参考信息。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 命令参考\nIBM Spectrum LSF命令的参考。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF 配置参考\n了解 IBM Spectrum LSF 的相关功能，文件，事件和环境变量的配置参数。\n\nIBM Spectrum LSF API 参考\n请参阅对 IBM Spectrum LSF API 的全面参考。\n\n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 09:11:45\n"},"chapter7/section1/Command_reference.html":{"url":"chapter7/section1/Command_reference.html","title":"7.1 Command reference","keywords":"","body":"7.1 Command reference\nReference for IBM Spectrum LSF commands.\n\nbacct\nDisplays accounting statistics about finished jobs.\nbadmin\nThe badmin command is the administrative tool for LSF.\nbapp\nDisplays information about application profile configuration.\nbattach\nRuns a shell process to connect to an existing job execution host or container.\nbattr\nProvides a set of subcommands to manage LSF host attributes for attribute affinity scheduling.\nbbot\nMoves a pending job to the bottom of the queue relative to the last job in the queue.\nbchkpnt\nCheckpoints one or more checkpointable jobs\nbclusters\nDisplays information about IBM Spectrum LSF multicluster capability\nbconf\nSubmits live reconfiguration requests, updating configuration settings in active memory without restarting daemons.\nbdata\nProvides a set of subcommands to query and manage IBM Spectrum LSF Data Manager.
