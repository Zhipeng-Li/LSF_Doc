running.\n\nDONE\nFinished normally with zero exit value.\n\nEXIT\nFinished with nonzero exit value.\n\nPSUSP\nSuspended while the job is pending.\n\nUSUSP\nSuspended by user.\n\nSSUSP\nSuspended by the LSF system.\n\nPOST_DONE\nPost-processing completed without errors.\n\nPOST_ERR\nPost-processing completed with errors.\n\nUNKWN\nThe mbatchd daemon lost contact with the sbatchd daemon on the host where the job runs.\n\nWAIT\nFor jobs submitted to a chunk job queue, members of a chunk job that are waiting to run.\n\nZOMBI\nA job becomes ZOMBI if the execution host is unreachable when a non-rerunnable job is killed or a rerunnable job is requeued.\n\n\nHost\nAn LSF host is an individual computer in the cluster.\nEach host might have more than one processor. Multiprocessor hosts are used to run parallel jobs. A multiprocessor host with a single process queue is considered a single machine. A box full of processors that each have their own process queue is treated as a group of separate machines.\nTip\nThe names of your hosts should be unique. They cannot be the same as the cluster name or any queue that is defined for the cluster.\nJob\nAn LSF job is a unit of work that runs in the LSF system.\nA job is a command that is submitted to LSF for execution, by using the bsub command. LSF schedules, controls, and tracks the job according to configured policies.\nJobs can be complex problems, simulation scenarios, extensive calculations, anything that needs compute power.\nJob files\nWhen a job is submitted to a queue, LSF holds it in a job file until conditions are right for it run. Then, the job file is used to run the job.\nOn UNIX, the job file is a Bourne shell script that is run at execution time.\nOn Windows, the job file is a batch file that is processed at execution time.\nInteractive batch job\nAn interactive batch job is a batch job that allows you to interact with the application and still take advantage of LSFscheduling policies and fault tolerance.\nAll input and output are through the terminal that you used to type the job submission command.\nWhen you submit an interactive job, a message is displayed while the job is awaiting scheduling. A new job cannot be submitted until the interactive job is completed or terminated.\nInteractive task\nAn interactive task is a command that is not submitted to a batch queue and scheduled by LSF, but is dispatched immediately.\nLSF locates the resources that are needed by the task and chooses the best host among the candidate hosts that has the required resources and is lightly loaded. Each command can be a single process, or it can be a group of cooperating processes.\nTasks are run without using the batch processing features of LSF but still with the advantage of resource requirements and selection of the best host to run the task based on load.\nLocal task\nA local task is an application or command that does not make sense to run remotely.\nFor example, the ls command on UNIX.\nRemote task\nA remote task is an application or command that that can be run on another machine in the cluster.\nHost types and host models\nHosts in LSF are characterized by host type and host model.\nThe following example is a host with type X86_64, with host models Opteron240, Opteron840, Intel_EM64T, and so on.\n\nHost type\nAn LSF host type is the combination of operating system and host CPU architecture.\nAll computers that run the same operating system on the same computer architecture are of the same type. These hosts are binary-compatible with each other.\nEach host type usually requires a different set of LSF binary files.\nHost model\nAn LSF host model is the host type of the computer, which determines the CPU speed scaling factor that is applied in load and placement calculations.\nThe CPU factor is considered when jobs are being dispatched.\nResources\nLSF resources are objects in the LSF system resources that LSF uses track job requirements and schedule jobs according to their availability on individual hosts.\nResource usage\nThe LSF system uses built-in and configured resources to track resource availability and usage. Jobs are scheduled according to the resources available on individual hosts.\nJobs that are submitted through the LSF system will have the resources that they use monitored while they are running. This information is used to enforce resource limits and load thresholds as well as fairshare scheduling.\nLSF collects the following kinds of information:\n\nTotal CPU time that is consumed by all processes in the job\nTotal resident memory usage in KB of all currently running processes in a job\nTotal virtual memory usage in KB of all currently running processes in a job\nCurrently active process group ID in a job\nCurrently active processes in a job\n\nOn UNIX and Linux, job-level resource usage is collected through PIM.\nLoad indices\nLoad indices measure the availability of dynamic, non-shared resources on hosts in the cluster. Load indices that are built into the LIM are updated at fixed time intervals.\nExternal load indices\nDefined and configured by the LSF administrator and collected by an External Load Information Manager (ELIM) program. The ELIM also updates LIM when new values are received.\nStatic resources\nBuilt-in resources that represent host information that does not change over time, such as the maximum RAM available to user processes or the number of processors in a machine. Most static resources are determined by the LIM at start-up time.\nStatic resources can be used to select appropriate hosts for particular jobs that are based on binary architecture, relative CPU speed, and system configuration.\nLoad thresholds\nTwo types of load thresholds can be configured by your LSF administrator to schedule jobs in queues. Each load threshold specifies a load index value:\n\nThe loadSched load threshold determines the load condition for dispatching pending jobs. If a host’s load is beyond any defined loadSched, a job cannot be started on the host. This threshold is also used as the condition for resuming suspended jobs.\nThe loadStop load threshold determines when running jobs can be suspended.\n\nTo schedule a job on a host, the load levels on that host must satisfy both the thresholds that are configured for that host and the thresholds for the queue from which the job is being dispatched.\nThe value of a load index might either increase or decrease with load, depending on the meaning of the specific load index. Therefore, when you compare the host load conditions with the threshold values, you need to use either greater than (>) or less than (\nRuntime resource usage limits\nLimit the use of resources while a job is running. Jobs that consume more than the specified amount of a resource are signaled.\nHard and soft limits\nResource limits that are specified at the queue level are hard limits while limits that are specified with job submission are soft limits. See the setrlimit man page for information about hard and soft limits.\nResource allocation limits\nRestrict the amount of a resource that must be available during job scheduling for different classes of jobs to start, and which resource consumers the limits apply to. If all of the resource is consumed, no more jobs can be started until some of the resource is released.\nResource requirements (bsub -R)\nThe bsub -R option specifies resources requirements for the job. Resource requirements restrict which hosts the job can run on. Hosts that match the resource requirements are the candidate hosts. When LSF schedules a job, it collects the load index values of all the candidate hosts and compares them to the scheduling conditions. Jobs are only dispatched to a host if all load values are within the scheduling thresholds. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-05 19:22:25\n"},"chapter4/section1/cluster_characteristics.html":{"url":"chapter4/section1/cluster_characteristics.html","title":"集群特征","keywords":"","body":"集群特征\nFind the name of your cluster after installation, cluster administrators, and where hosts are defined.\nCluster name and administrators\nYour cluster is installed according to the installation options specified by the lsfinstall -f install.configcommand and the options you chose in the install.config file.

After installation, you can change the configuration parameters in these files to suit the needs of your site.\n\nWho owns these files\nExcept for LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf, which is owned by root, all of these files are owned by the primary LSF administrator, and readable by all cluster users.\n\nlsf.conf\nThe most important file in LSF. It contains the paths to the configuration directories, log directories, libraries, and other global configuration information. The location of the lsf.conf file is defined by the LSF_ENVDIR variable. If LSF cannot find this file, it cannot start properly.By default, LSF checks the directory that is defined by the LSF_ENVDIR parameter for the location of the lsf.conf file. If the lsf.conf file is not in LSF_ENVDIR, LSF looks for it in the /etc directory.\n\nlsf.cluster.cluster_name\nDefines the host names, models, and types of all of the hosts in the cluster. It also defines the user names of the LSF administrators, and the locations of different shared resources for one cluster.\n\nlsf.shared\nThis file is like a dictionary that defines all the keywords that are used by the cluster. You can add your own keywords to specify the names of resources or host types.\n\nlsb.queues\nDefines the workload queues and their parameters for one cluster.\n\n\nLSF directories\nThe following directories are owned by the primary LSF administrator and are readable by all cluster users:\n\n\n\n\nDirectory\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nLSF_CONFDIR\nLSF configuration directory\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/\n\n\nLSB_CONFDIR\nBatch system configuration directory\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/lsbatch/\n\n\nLSB_SHAREDIR\nJob history directory\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/work/\n\n\nLSF_LOGDIR\nServer daemon error logs, one for each daemon\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/log/\n\n\n\n\nThe following directories are owned by root and are readable by all cluster users:\n\n\n\n\nDirectory\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nLSF_BINDIR\nLSF user commands, which are shared by all hosts of the same type\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/bin/\n\n\nLSF_INCLUDEDIR\nHeader files lsf/lsf.h and lsf/lsbatch.h\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/include/\n\n\nLSF_LIBDIR\nLSF libraries, which are shared by all hosts of the same type\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/lib/\n\n\nLSF_MANDIR\nLSF man pages\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/man/\n\n\nLSF_MISC\nExamples and other miscellaneous files\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/misc/\n\n\nLSF_SERVERDIR\nServer daemon binary files, scripts, and other utilities, which are shared by all hosts of the same type\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/etc/\n\n\nLSF_TOP\nTop-level installation directory\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/\n\n\n\n\nOther configuration directories can be specified in the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf file.\nLSF cluster configuration files\nThe following files are owned by the primary LSF administrator and are readable by all cluster users:\n\n\n\n\nFile\nExample\n\n\n\n\nGlobal configuration files, which describe the configuration and operation of the cluster\n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/ego/cluster1/kernel/ego.conf/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/lsf.conf\n\n\nKeyword definition file that is shared by all clusters.

A wrapper script is an executable file for launching your application through LSF. It gives users a simple interface to run their jobs that is easy to deploy and maintain.\nFor example, if your application is called abc, rename abc to abc_real and create a wrapper script that is called abc:\n#! /bin/sh\nbsub -R \"rusage[abc_license=1:duration=1]\" abc_real\nWhen users run abc, they are actually running a script to submit a job abc_real to LSF that uses 1 shared resource named abc_license.\nFor more information about specifying shared resources by using the resource requirement (rusage) string on the -R option of the bsub command, see Manage software licenses and other shared resources.\nBy adding appropriate options to the script, you can enhance your integration:\n\nRequeue jobs based on license availability\nCopy input and output files to and from the local directory on the execution host\nCalculate and estimate resource requirements\n\nWrapper binary programs\nA wrapper binary is similar to a wrapper shell script in the form of a compiled binary executable. Compiled wrapper files usually run faster and more efficiently than shell scripts, and they also have access to the LSF API (LSLIB and LSBLIB). Binary code is also more secure because users cannot modify it without the source code and appropriate libraries, but it is more time consuming to develop wrapper binary programs than wrapper shell scripts.\nModifying existing application source code and interfaces\nLSF is already integrated closely with many commonly used software products. IBM and other software application vendors provide facilities and services for closer integration of LSF and other applications. By modifying existing application user interfaces, you can enable easy job submission, license maximization, parallel execution, and other advanced LSF features. In some cases, you are able to run an LSF job directly from the application user interface.\nWhere to go next\nLearn more about administering your cluster, described in Manage users, hosts, and queues. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 23:31:01\n"},"chapter4/section2/subsection4/manage_users_hosts_and_queues.html":{"url":"chapter4/section2/subsection4/manage_users_hosts_and_queues.html","title":"管理用户、节点与队列","keywords":"","body":"管理用户、节点与队列\nMake your cluster available to users with cshrc.lsf and profile.lsf.

LSF manages shared resources for host selection and batch or interactive job execution. These resources are dynamic resources because the load on the system changes with the availability of the resources.\nSoftware licenses as shared resources\nThe most common application of shared resources is to manage software application licenses. You submit jobs that require those licenses and LSF runs the jobs according to their priorities when licenses are available. When licenses are not available, LSF queues the jobs then dispatches them when licenses are free. Configuring application licenses as shared resources ensures optimal use of costly and critical resources.\nDefine dynamic shared resources in an ELIM\nFor LSF to use a shared resource like a software license, you must define the resource in the Resource section of the lsf.shared file. You define the type of resource and how often you want LSF to refresh the value of the resource.\nFor LSF to track the resources correctly over time, you must define them as external load indexes. LSF updates load indexes periodically with a program called an External Load Information Manager (ELIM).\nAn ELIM can be a shell script or a compiled binary program, which returns the values of the shared resources you define. The ELIM must be named elim and located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory:\n/usr/share/lsf/lsf/cluser1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/elim\nYou can find examples of sample ELIMs in the misc/examples directory.\nExample of shared licenses\nIn the lsf.shared file, define two dynamic shared resources for software licenses, named license1 and license2:\nBegin Resource\nRESOURCENAME  TYPE    INTERVAL INCREASING  RELEASE   DESCRIPTION   # Keywords\nlicense1      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license1 resource)\nlicense2      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license2 resource)\nEnd Resource\n\nThe\n\n  TYPE\n  parameter for a shared resource can be one of the following types:\n\nNumeric\nBoolean\nString\nIn this case, the resource is Numeric.\n\n\n\nThe INTERVAL parameter specifies how often you want the value to be refreshed. In this example, the ELIM updates the value of the shared resources license1 and license2 every 30 seconds.\n\nThe N in the INCREASING column means that the license resources are decreasing; that is, as more licenses become available, the load becomes lower.\n\nThe Y in the RELEASE column means that the license resources are released when a job that uses the license is suspended.\n\n\nMap dynamic shared resources to hosts\nTo make LSF aware of where the defined dynamic shared resources license1 and license2 you defined, map them to the hosts where they are located.\nIn the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.cluster.cluster_name file, configure a ResourceMap section to specify the mapping between shared resources license1 and license2 you defined in the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.shared file, and the hosts you want to map them to:\nBegin ResourceMap\nRESOURCENAME  LOCATION\nlicense1      [all]\nlicense1      [all]\nEnd ResourceMap\nIn this resource map, the [all] attribute under the LOCATION parameter means that resources license1 and license2 under the RESOURCENAME parameter are available on all hosts in the cluster. Only one ELIM needs to run on the master host because the two resources are the same for all hosts. If the location of the resources is different on different hosts, a different ELIM must run on every host.\nMonitor dynamic shared resources\nFor LSF to receive external load indexes correctly, the ELIM must send a count of the available resources to standard output in the following format:\nnumber_indexes [index_name index_value] ...\nThe fields in this example contain the following information:\n2 license1 3 license2 2\n\nThe total number of external load indexes (2)\nThe name of the first external load index (license1)\nThe value of the first load index (3)\nThe name of the second external load index (license2)\nThe value of the second load index (2)\n\nWrite the ELIM program\nThe ELIM must be an executable program, named elim, located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory.\nWhen the lim daemon is started or restarted, it runs the elim program on the same host and takes the standard output of the external load indexes that are sent by the elim program. In general, you can define any quantifiable resource as an external load index, write an ELIM to report its value, and use it as an LSF resource.\nThe following example ELIM program uses license1 and license2 and assumes that the FLEXlm license server controls them:\n#!/bin/sh \nNUMLIC=2           # number of dynamic shared resources\nwhile true\ndo\nTMPLICS='/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/lic -c \n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/license.dat -f license1, license2'\n\nLICS='echo $TMPLICS | sed -e s/-/_/g'\necho $NUMLIC $LICS # $NUMLIC is number of dynamic shared \nresource\nsleep 30           # Resource\ndone\nIn the script, the sed command changes the minus sign (-) to underscore (_) in the license feature names because LSF uses the minus sign for calculation, and it is not allowed in resource names.\nThe lic utility is available from IBM Support. You can also use the FLEXlm command lmstat to make your own ELIM.\nUse the dynamic shared resources\nTo enable the new shared resources in your cluster, restart LSF with the following commands:\n\nlsadmin reconfig\nbadmin reconfig\n\nIf no errors are found, use the lsload -l command to verify the value of your dynamic shared resources:\nHOST_NAME  status r15s  r1m  r15m  ut   pg   io  ls  it  tmp  swp  mem license1 license2\nhosta          ok  0.1  0.3  0.4   8%   0.2  50  73   0  62M  700M 425M       3        0 \nhostb          ok  0.1  0.1  0.4   4%   5.7   3   3   0  79M  204M  64M       3        0\nSubmit jobs that use shared resources\nTo submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource, use the command following command:\n% bsub -R 'rusage[license1=1:duration=1]' myjob\nIn the resource requirement (rusage) string, duration=1 means that license1 is reserved for 1 minute to give LSF time to check it out from FLEXlm.\nYou can also specify the resource requirement string at queue level, in the RES_REQ parameter for the queue. In the LSB_CONFDIR/cluster_name/configdir/lsb.queues file, specify the following resource requirement string:\nBegin Queue\nQUEUE_NAME = license1\nRES_REQ=rusage[license1=1:duration=1]\n...\nEnd Queue\nThen, submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource by using the following command:\n% bsub -q license1 myjob\nWhen licenses are available, LSF runs your jobs right away; when all licenses are in use, LSF puts your job in a queue and dispatches them as licenses become available. This way, all of your licenses are used to the best advantage.\nFor more information\n\nFor more information about the lsf.shared and lsf.cluster.cluster_name files and the parameters for configuring shared resources, see the Configuration Reference.\nFor more information about adding external resources to your cluster and configuring an ELIM to customize resources, see External load indices in
