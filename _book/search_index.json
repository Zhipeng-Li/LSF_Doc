LSF: 高效的集群管理系统\n计算机通过执行程序，帮助科研人员进行科学研究。通常，计算机的使用者不关心程序的执行过程，他们只希望更快更有效地获取运算结果。而为了提供强大的计算能力，大量的计算资源以集群的形式出现。集群系统的使用和有效管理都面临着挑战。\nLSF（Load Sharing Facility）是一款分布式集群管理系统软件，负责计算资源的管理和批处理作业的调度。它给用户提供统一的集群资源访问接口，让用户透明地访问整个集群资源。同时提供了丰富的功能和可定制的策略。LSF 具有良好的可伸缩性和高可用性，支持几乎所有的主流操作系统。它通常是高性能计算环境中不可或缺的基础软件。\nLSF 虽然是一款商业软件，但它同时也提供免费的社区版供大家下载和使用。\n简单的使用\nLSF 的使用者可以大约分为两类，普通用户和集群系统管理员。普通用户可以通过命令，将计算程序提交给集群执行，获取计算结果。系统管理员可以通过配置文件和管理命令，管理集群以及统计计算资源的使用情况。\n图 1. LSF 结构图\n\n普通用户提交可执行程序或脚本给 LSF。LSF 将已提交的程序称为作业。作业在LSF 的队列 (Queue) 里排队 (PEND) ，等待调度。\n清单 1.  提交作业\nlsfrhel01 # bsub –R \"linux\" sleep 1000\nJob  is submitted to default queue .\nlsfrhel01 # bjobs\nJOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME\n1       tom     PEND  normal     lsfrhel01               *eep 1000  May  9 15:42\n\nLSF 根据配置的调度策略，把作业分配到最合适的计算节点上执行 (RUN) 。用户可以通过命令行查看，控制作业的执行过程。除此之外，LSF 还为用户提供了作业修改，需求描述，作业控制等多种命令行工具。\n清单 2. 查看运行作业\nlsfrhel01 # bjobs\nJOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME\n1       tom     RUN   normal     lsfrhel01   lsfrhel02   *eep 1000  May  9 15:42\n\n系统管理员通常需要了解整个集群系统中作业和资源的使用状况，LSF 提供的命令帮助管理员快速直观地看到系统概况：系统中队列的状态，机器的状态，作业的资源使用概况，等等。除此之外，LSF 还为管理员提供了丰富的集群配置，控制，管理等功能。\n清单 3. 查看 LSF 系统信息\nlsfrhel01 # bqueues normal\nQUEUE_NAME      PRIO STATUS          MAX JL/U JL/P JL/H NJOBS  PEND   RUN  SUSP\nnormal           30  Open:Active       -    -

Host）。它们既可以提交作业，也可以执行作业。按照职能的不同，服务节点可以有不同的身份。管理作业调度资源的节点称为主节点（Master host），一个集群只有一个主节点。对于一次作业提交来说，提交作业的节点为提交节点（Submission host），被分配并执行作业的节点是执行节点（Execution host）。\n图 2. 节点角色\n\n为了便于机器的管理，LSF 提供节点组（Host group）的概念。任意的机器集合可以被作为整体命名，通过名字在集群范围内整体引用。一种典型的用法是将节点按照内存大小进行分类：大内存节点组和小内存节点组。不同的作业可以请求不同的节点组，LSF 按照请求，分配该节点组中的机器来执行作业。节点组还有一个灵活的特性：为方便管理，同一台机器可以定义到不同的节点组。\n图 3. 节点分组\n\n作业占用机器资源进行计算。每一个机器被划分成若干个槽位（slot） 。每一个槽位通常可以容纳一个作业运行。 通常情况下，每一个槽位和一个CPU 核心（core）相对应。槽位是一个容易混淆的概念，为便于理解，可以将槽位等同于CPU 核心来看待。对于并行作业来说，比如MPI 作业，每一个都需要占用更多的槽位加速计算。\n作业的管理是以队列（Queue）为单位的，调度的策略也是按照队列定制的。作为作业的容器，可以配置多个队列定制不同策略。LSF 按照队列的优先级，从高到低调度每一个队列中的作业，为其分配资源。高优先级队列的作业对资源的使用具有优先权。\n图 4. 调度方式\n\n　　\n用户是作业提交者，也是资源的真正使用者。对于资源和作业的管理，不少策略都是以用户为单位。为了更好管理用户，LSF 引入用户组（user group）。若干用户集合可以统一命名，并使用该命名统一引用。例如，一个人属于一个部门，一个部门可以作为一个用户组，这种情况下就可以使用部门名字命名和引用。\n体系结构\nLSF 采用传统的客户机服务器模式，主节点负责整个集群的管理，从节点负责管理运行其上的作业的管理。每一个服务节点包含三个后台进程：\n\nSbatchd\n\n批处理作业管理进程。负责在本节点上执行作业，监控作业状态以及收集其使用的资源。同时根据用户请求或者系统策略触发，控制作业的状态，比如发送SIGSTOP 给作业、挂起作业运行等。\n\nRES\n\n远程执行服务进程。负责执行远程客户请求的任务，主要用于并行作业的远程任务启动、监控以及控制。\n\nLIM\n\n采集本节点的负载信息进程。将收集到的资源负载信息周期上报给主节点上的LIM。主节点的LIM 拥有整个集群资源状态，为其它服务提供集群系统范围内的资源当前快照。\n主管理节点在这个基础上，包括两个额外的进程：\n\nMbatchd\n\n集群管理服务进程。它是 LSF 的中心：通过主节点的 LIM 获取机器以及相关资源信息，处理远程用户的作业提交请求，委托 mbschd 将作业调度到相关资源上，发送调度结果到指定机器，并通过和 sbatchd 的交互，监控作业使用的资源，控制作业的执行过程。\n\nMbschd\n\n调度策略服务进程。从 mbachd 获取作业和资源信息，根据定制策略，为 mbatchd 提供作业调度服务。\n图 5. 体系结构\n\n当一个新作业提交的时候，集群管理服务进程检查作业的合法性，并将作业放入到指定的队列中等待调度。经过调度的作业，将获得执行机器上的slot、内存等资源。LSF 负责保留相关资源并将作业指派到已分配机器上执行。作业的状态和实际使用的资源通过批处理作业管理进程报告给集群管理进程。\n集群系统构建在分布式网络节点上，节点的失效和网路设备的故障都会导致集群系统的基础环境改变。集群系统的高可用性功能可以保证即使在底层设备故障，LSF 系统仍然可以提供可靠稳定的服务。LSF 采用主备模式实现系统的故障恢复。LSF 的主节点将运行时事件信息写入网络文件系统。当主节点失效后，相关备节点进行选举，选出新的主节点。新的主节点从事件信息文件中恢复作业信息、机器状态，最终获取集群控制权，恢复LSF 状态。\n为了更进一步扩展 LSF 的资源管理范围和方式，在单一集群基础上，LSF 还提供多集群互联技术（Multi-Cluster）。多集群通过互联，共享跨集群资源，提供更强大的计算能力。下面是一种典型的多集群架构，集群 1 负责接收作业提交和转发，集群 2 和 集群 3 负责作业执行。\n图 6. 多集群结构\n\n资源调度\nLSF 收集每一个节点的处理器、内存、交换区、临时存储区等资源信息。主节点掌握全局资源信息。资源的管理和调度以这些信息为基础。\n清单 4. 查看节点资源负载信息\nlsfrhel01 # lshosts\nHOST_NAME      type    model  cpuf ncpus

2     1 2391M  1.2G  603M\n\n作业在使用资源的时候，主要考虑三个方面：如何根据作业的资源描述选择合适的执行机器，如何预留机器资源减少运行时的资源竞争，以及如何限制作业对资源的使用避免作业过度消耗资源。\n首先是选择执行机。每一个作业会有不同的资源需求。可以通过 LSF 定义的资源描述模式请求资源，运行节点由LSF 根据作业对资源描述来匹配。当一个作业需要一定量内存的时候，\"select[mem>512]\" 表示选择内存大于512M 的机器来运行作业。调度器为其选择拥有合适资源的机器。\n其次是确保执行机上的资源分配。既然我们选择了大内存的机器，那么别人的作业也可以选择大内存的机器。如果很多作业都在大内存机器上运行，资源竞争会导致内存短缺，作业最终无法占用到请求的资源。为了更好的确保资源，我们需要在作业运行时保留这些资源不会再分配给别人的作业。\"rusage[mem=512]\" 表示保留 512M                内存给作业，节点当前可用内存将会有 512M 分配给该作业，节点可分配资源将减少512M 的内存。通过 LSF                的策略，可用内存的分配得到控制，已经保留的内存将不会再分配给其它的作业。\n最后是保证资源不被过度消耗。资源的保留是通过 LSF 的策略保证，但是作业的进程在运行时，却尚未受 LSF                控制。我们需要在执行节点上，对作业的系统资源设置限制，保证作业（进程）本身不会吃掉过多的内存。通常我们可以设置一个资源上限，防止作业过度消耗资源。比如，内存限制 '1024M'，防止作业使用超过1G 的内存。\n清单 5. 提交内存需求的作业\n$ bsub -M 1024 -R \"select[mem>512] rusage[mem=512]\" sleep 1000\nJob  is

CPU、交换区、临时目录大小等等。虽然这些默认管理的资源始终是有限的，但是 LSF 还提供了资源管理的扩展机制。用户可以统过编写自己的 ELIM 来收集自定义的资源。比如，收集系统的网络带宽以及网络负载，作业可以通过资源描述，选择拥有相应带宽的节点执行作业。资源的种类很多，LSF 提供布尔类型、字符串类型和数字类型来描述多种多样的资源。\n定制策略\nLSF 提供了非常丰富的调度策略供 LSF 系统管理员选择配置。策略针对作业和资源，从提高资源利用率、优化资源分配、提高用户满意度等各个方面为资源的使用者和管理者提供可配置策略。\n默认的策略是先来先服务（FCFS）。顾名思义，先提交的作业先调度，优先获得资源。排在后面的作业必须等待前面的作业运行完成才能开始。后提交作业可能在很长时间得不到机会运行。考虑到资源分配的公平问题，比如部门之间应该平等使用资源，公平共享（Fairshare）策略得以引入。通过配置以部门为单位的用户组平等分享资源，不同用户的作业优先考虑资源所有权。避免了先来先服务导致的资源不平等，从而优化资源分配。\n公平共享是从资源分配公平性上考虑问题的，它达到的是一个最终资源使用公平的平衡。但是在使用过程中，如果其他人或者部门没有作业，那么整个集群的资源将会被分配给目前已经提交的作业。作业执行期间，即便新的作业拥有更多的资源优先使用权，也要等待其他作业执行完毕，释放资源后才能执行。这样在短时期内资源使用是不公平的。对于拥有资源使用权却无法执行的情况，资源保障（Resource Guarantee）策略可以为用户保留资源，随时可用。这是在牺牲资源利用率基础上提高用户满意度。\n对于并行作业，通常要求很多的 slot，当系统资源紧张的时候，即使等待很久依然无法运行。当系统释放一个 slot                的时候，这个作业因为发现资源不够，便放弃对资源的优先权。排在后面的只需要一个 slot 的作业将获取资源执行。这个过程反复着，并行作业始终无法获取足够资源。为了解决这个问题引入了资源保留策略。虽然当前资源不够运行的，但是这个资源暂时被并行作业占有，等待后面不断释放的资源，直到 slot 满足作业的需求。\n但是长时间的等待还是会浪费这些空闲资源，因此又加入回填策略。在不影响并行作业启动时间的前提下，可以将短作业优先调度到已经被保留的 slot 上。\n对于特权或者紧急的用户或者应用，当系统资源完全使用的时候。为了尽快执行，抢占（Preemption）策略可以通过抢占已执行作业的资源，执行自己的作业。\n除此之外，为了满足用户需求，LSF 提供了资源预留（Advanced Reservation）、SLA 等等。为了提高资源利用率，LSF 提供了NUMA绑定（Affinity）策略等等。对于详尽的策略，可以参考 LSF 管理员手册。LSF 的很多策略都可以自由组合，通过管理员的配置，最终形成丰富的，满足各种需求的定制策略。\n即便所有的策略都不能满足你的要求，LSF 的调度策略还实现了插件机制。新的扩展可以通过 LSF 提供的API 实现新的策略。\n总结\n在高性能计算领域，作业管理系统是一种成熟的系统软件技术。LSF 作为其中的佼佼者，提供了统一的访问接口，丰富的调度策略，灵活的配置和部署。LSF 的体系结构和部署方式让它可以有效管理一定规模的集群系统，目前商业版可以支持多达数千台节点和数百万作业的管理。LSF 的故障恢复机制足以保证集群系统的高可用性。在分布式计算技术不断发展的今天，作为传统的批处理管理软件，依然发挥着重要的作用。\n参考资源\n\n下载 IBM Spectrum LSF Community Edition，安装，试用LSF 的基本功能\n参考 IBM Spectrum

可以容许集群中，任何主机或主机组的故障。当某主机不可用时，在该主机上运行的所有作业，将会重新排队运行或丢失，具体取决于该作业是否被标记为可重新运行。其他挂起或正在运行的作业，则不会受到影响。\n故障转移的工作原理\n容错能力取决于事件日志文件 lsb.events，该文件保存在主文件服务器上。系统中的每个事件都记录在该文件中，包括所有作业提交以及作业和主机状态更改。如果主节点不可用，则从主节点候选列表中选择一个新的主节点，新的主节点上的 sbatchd 守护程序，将启动一个新的 mbatchd 守护程序。 新的 mbatchd 守护程序，会读取lsb.events 文件以恢复系统状态。\n重复事件记录\n对于不希望仅依靠中央文件服务器获取恢复信息的站点，可以将 LSF 配置为通过保留 lsb.events 文件的副本来维护重复的事件日志。 副本存储在文件服务器上，并且在主副本不可用时使用。 启用重复事件日志记录后，主事件日志将本地存储在第一个主主机上，并在主机恢复时与复制的副本重新同步。\n主机故障转移\nLSF 主节点是动态选择的。如果当前的主节点不可用，则另一台主机将自动接管。故障转移主机，是从  lsf.conf 文件（在安装时在 install.config 文件中指定）的 LSF_MASTER_LIST 参数中定义的列表中选择的。列表中的第一个可用节点充当主机。\n正在运行的作业由每个服务器主机上的 sbatchd 守护程序管理。 当新的 mbatchd 守护程序启动时，它将轮询每个主机上的 sbatchd 守护程序，并找到其作业状态。如果 sbatchd 守护程序失效，但主机仍在运行，则主机上正在运行的作业不会丢失。 重新启动 sbatchd 守护程序后，它将重新获得对主机上正在运行的所有作业的控制。\n作业故障转移\n作业可以通过可重新运行的方式来提交，如此一来，它们可以从头开始自动运行，也可以通过可检查点的形式提交，如此一来，如果由于主机故障而挂掉，则可以从另一个主机上的检查点重新开始。\n如果集群中的所有主机都关闭，则所有正在运行的作业都将丢失。 当主节点的候选节点，恢复并接管为主节点时，它将读取 lsb.events 文件，以获取所有批处理作业的状态。  除非系统将其标记为可重新运行，否则系统关闭时，正在运行的作业将被认为已退出，并且电子邮件将发送给提交用户。等待的作业则保留在队列中，并在主机可用时，进行调度。\n分区集群\n如果集群因网络故障而分区，则 master LIM 会接管分区的每一侧，而候选主节点则在分区的每一侧都可用。 当每个主机仍然可以访问 LSF 可执行文件时，交互式负载共享仍然可用。.\n分区网络\n如果对网络进行了分区，则只有一个分区可以访问 lsb.events 文件，因此 LSF 服务仅在分区的一侧可用。一个锁定文件，用于确保集群中仅运行一个 mbatchd 守护程序。\n作业异常处理\n您可以配置主机和队列，以便 LSF 在作业运行时检测到异常情况，并自动采取适当的措施。 您可以自定义检测到哪些异常以及相应的操作。 例如，您可以将 LSF 设置为在作业退出并显示特定错误代码时，自动重新启动。 \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-10

装满处理器的盒子，每个处理器都有自己的处理队列，被视为一组单独的计算机。\nTip\n主机的名称应唯一。 它们不能与集群名称或为集群定义的任何队列相同。\n作业\nLSF 作业是在 LSF 系统中运行的工作单元。\n作业是使用 bsub 命令提交给 LSF 以便执行的命令。 LSF 根据配置的策略计划，控制和跟踪作业。\n作业可能是复杂的问题，模拟方案，大量的计算，以及任何需要计算能力的事物。\n作业文件\n将作业提交到队列后，LSF 会将其保存在作业文件中，直到适合运行条件为止。 然后，使用作业文件运行作业。\n在 UNIX 上，作业文件是在执行时运行的 Bourne Shell 脚本。\n在 Windows 上，作业文件是在执行时处理的批处理文件。\n交互式批处理作业\n交互式批处理作业，是一个批处理作业，它使您可以与应用程序进行交互，并且仍然利用 LSF 调度策略和容错能力。\n所有输入和输出都是通过用于键入作业提交命令的终端进行的。\n提交交互式作业时，在作业等待调度时会显示一条消息。 在交互式作业完成或终止之前，无法提交新作业。\n交互式任务\n交互式任务是没有提交给批处理队列，并由 LSF 调度但立即分派的命令。\nLSF 查找任务所需的资源，并在具有所需资源且负载较轻的候选主机中选择最佳主机。 每个命令可以是单个进程，也可以是一组协作进程。\n在不使用 LSF 的批处理功能的情况下运行任务，但仍具有资源需求和根据负载选择最佳主机来运行任务的优势。\n本地任务\n本地任务是没有意义的应用程序或命令，不能远程运行。\n例如，UNIX上的 ls 命令。\n远程任务\n远程任务，是可以在集群中的另一台计算机上运行的应用程序或命令。\n主机类型与主机型号\nLSF中的主机，由主机类型和主机模型表征。\n以下示例是类型为 X86_64 的主机，其主机型号为 Opteron240，Opteron840，Intel_EM64T 等。\n\n主机类型\nLSF 主机类型，是操作系统和主机 CPU 体系结构的组合。\n在相同计算机体系结构上，运行相同操作系统的所有计算机都属于同一类型。 这些主机彼此二进制兼容。\n每种主机类型，通常需要一组不同的 LSF 二进制文件。\n主机型号\nLSF 主机模型是计算机的主机类型，它确定在负载和放置计算中应用的 CPU 速度缩放因子。\n调度作业时，要考虑 CPU 因素。\n资源\nLSF 资源是 LSF 系统资源中的对象，LSF 使用这些对象，来跟踪作业要求并根据它们在各个主机上的可用性来调度作业。\n资源使用\nLSF 系统使用内置的和配置的资源，来跟踪资源的可用性和使用情况。 根据各个主机上可用的资源，来调度作业。\n通过 LSF 系统提交的作业，在运行时将受到使用的资源的监视。 此信息用于强制执行资源限制，和负载阈值以及公平分配策略。\nLSF收集以下类型的信息：\n\n作业中，所有进程消耗的总 CPU 时间\n作业中，所有当前正在运行的进程的总常驻内存使用量（KB 为单位）\n作业中，所有当前正在运行的进程的总虚拟内存使用量（KB 为单位）\n作业中，当前活动的进程组 ID\n作业中，当前活跃的进程\n\n在 UNIX 和 Linux 上，通过 PIM 收集作业级资源使用情况。\n负载指数\n负载指数，衡量集群中主机上动态非共享资源的可用性。 内置在 LIM 中的负载指数，会按固定的时间间隔进行更新。\n外部负载指数\n由 LSF 管理员定义和配置，并由外部负载信息管理器（ELIM）程序收集。 当收到新值时，ELIM 也会更新 LIM。\n静态资源\n表示不会随时间变化的主机信息的内置资源，例如，可用于用户进程的最大 RAM 或计算机中的处理器数量。 大多数静态资源由 LIM 在启动时确定。\n静态资源，可用于根据二进制体系结构，相对 CPU 速度和系统配置，为特定作业选择适当的主机。\n负载阈值\n您的 LSF 管理员，可以配置两种类型的负载阈值来调度队列中的作业。 每个负载阈值指定一个负载索引值：\n\nloadSched 负载阈值，确定用于调度待处理作业的负载条件。 如果主机的负载超出任何定义的 loadSched，则无法在主机上启动作业。 此阈值还用作恢复挂起作业的条件。\nloadStop 负载阈值，确定何时可以暂停正在运行的作业。\n\n要在主机上调度作业，该主机上的负载级别，必须同时满足为该主机配置的阈值，和要从中调度作业的队列的阈值。\n负载索引的值，可能随负载而增加或减少，具体取决于特定负载索引的含义。 因此，将主机负载条件与阈值进行比较时，需要根据负载指数使用大于（>）或小于（\n运行时资源使用限制\n在作业运行时限制资源的使用。 发出消耗超过指定资源量的作业的信号。\n硬性限制和软性限制\n在队列级别指定的资源限制是硬限制，而在作业提交中指定的资源限制是软限制。 有关硬限制和软限制的信息，请参见 setrlimit 手册页。\n资源分配限制\n限制在作业调度期间是必须启动的，用于启动不同类别的作业的资源量，以及限制适用于哪些资源使用者。 如果消耗了所有资源，则在释放某些资源之前，无法启动更多作业。\n资源需求 (bsub -R)\nbsub -R 选项指定作业的资源要求。 资源要求限制了可以在其上运行作业的主机。 符合资源要求的主机，是候选主机。 当 LSF 调度作业时，它将收集所有候选主机的负载索引值，并将它们与调度条件进行比较。 仅当所有负载值均在调度阈值之内时，作业才会调度到主机。\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by

A wrapper script is an executable file for launching your application through LSF. It gives users a simple interface to run their jobs that is easy to deploy and maintain.\nFor example, if your application is called abc, rename abc to abc_real and create a wrapper script that is called abc:\n#! /bin/sh\nbsub -R \"rusage[abc_license=1:duration=1]\" abc_real\nWhen users run abc, they are actually running a script to submit a job abc_real to LSF that uses 1 shared resource named abc_license.\nFor more information about specifying shared resources by using the resource requirement (rusage) string on the -R option of the bsub command, see Manage software licenses and other shared resources.\nBy adding appropriate options to the script, you can enhance your integration:\n\nRequeue jobs based on license availability\nCopy input and output files to and from the local directory on the execution host\nCalculate and estimate resource requirements\n\nWrapper binary programs\nA wrapper binary is similar to a wrapper shell script in the form of a compiled binary executable. Compiled wrapper files usually run faster and more efficiently than shell scripts, and they also have access to the LSF API (LSLIB and LSBLIB). Binary code is also more secure because users cannot modify it without the source code and appropriate libraries, but it is more time consuming to develop wrapper binary programs than wrapper shell scripts.\nModifying existing application source code and interfaces\nLSF is already integrated closely with many commonly used software products. IBM and other software application vendors provide facilities and services for closer integration of LSF and other applications. By modifying existing application user interfaces, you can enable easy job submission, license maximization, parallel execution, and other advanced LSF features.

LSF manages shared resources for host selection and batch or interactive job execution. These resources are dynamic resources because the load on the system changes with the availability of the resources.\nSoftware licenses as shared resources\nThe most common application of shared resources is to manage software application licenses. You submit jobs that require those licenses and LSF runs the jobs according to their priorities when licenses are available. When licenses are not available, LSF queues the jobs then dispatches them when licenses are free. Configuring application licenses as shared resources ensures optimal use of costly and critical resources.\nDefine dynamic shared resources in an ELIM\nFor LSF to use a shared resource like a software license, you must define the resource in the Resource section of the lsf.shared file. You define the type of resource and how often you want LSF to refresh the value of the resource.\nFor LSF to track the resources correctly over time, you must define them as external load indexes. LSF updates load indexes periodically with a program called an External Load Information Manager (ELIM).\nAn ELIM can be a shell script or a compiled binary program, which returns the values of the shared resources you define. The ELIM must be named elim and located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory:\n/usr/share/lsf/lsf/cluser1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/elim\nYou can find examples of sample ELIMs in the misc/examples directory.\nExample of shared licenses\nIn the lsf.shared file, define two dynamic shared resources for software licenses, named license1 and license2:\nBegin Resource\nRESOURCENAME  TYPE    INTERVAL INCREASING  RELEASE   DESCRIPTION   # Keywords\nlicense1      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license1 resource)\nlicense2      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license2 resource)\nEnd Resource\n\nThe TYPE parameter for a shared resource can be one of the following types:\n\nNumeric\n\n\nBoolean\n\nString\n\nIn this case, the resource is Numeric.\n\nThe INTERVAL parameter specifies how often you want the value to be refreshed. In this example, the ELIM updates the value of the shared resources license1 and license2 every 30 seconds.\n\nThe N in the INCREASING column means that the license resources are decreasing; that is, as more licenses become available, the load becomes lower.\n\nThe Y in the RELEASE column means that the license resources are released when a job that uses the license is suspended.\n\n\nMap dynamic shared resources to hosts\nTo make LSF aware of where the defined dynamic shared resources license1 and license2 you defined, map them to the hosts where they are located.\nIn the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.cluster.cluster_name file, configure a ResourceMap section to specify the mapping between shared resources license1 and license2 you defined in the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.shared file, and the hosts you want to map them to:\nBegin ResourceMap\nRESOURCENAME  LOCATION\nlicense1      [all]\nlicense1      [all]\nEnd ResourceMap\nIn this resource map, the [all] attribute under the LOCATION parameter means that resources license1 and license2 under the RESOURCENAME parameter are available on all hosts in the cluster. Only one ELIM needs to run on the master host because the two resources are the same for all hosts. If the location of the resources is different on different hosts, a different ELIM must run on every host.\nMonitor dynamic shared resources\nFor LSF to receive external load indexes correctly, the ELIM must send a count of the available resources to standard output in the following format:\nnumber_indexes [index_name index_value] ...\nThe fields in this example contain the following information:\n2 license1 3 license2 2\n\nThe total number of external load indexes (2)\nThe name of the first external load index (license1)\nThe value of the first load index (3)\nThe name of the second external load index (license2)\nThe value of the second load index (2)\n\nWrite the ELIM program\nThe ELIM must be an executable program, named elim, located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory.\nWhen the lim daemon is started or restarted, it runs the elim program on the same host and takes the standard output of the external load indexes that are sent by the elim program. In general, you can define any quantifiable resource as an external load index, write an ELIM to report its value, and use it as an LSF resource.\nThe following example ELIM program uses license1 and license2 and assumes that the FLEXlm license server controls them:\n#!/bin/sh \nNUMLIC=2           # number of dynamic shared resources\nwhile true\ndo\nTMPLICS='/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/lic -c \n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/license.dat -f license1, license2'\n\nLICS='echo $TMPLICS | sed -e s/-/_/g'\necho $NUMLIC $LICS # $NUMLIC is number of dynamic shared \nresource\nsleep 30           # Resource\ndone\nIn the script, the sed command changes the minus sign (-) to underscore (_) in the license feature names because LSF uses the minus sign for calculation, and it is not allowed in resource names.\nThe lic utility is available from IBM Support. You can also use the FLEXlm command lmstat to make your own ELIM.\nUse the dynamic shared resources\nTo enable the new shared resources in your cluster, restart LSF with the following commands:\n\nlsadmin reconfig\nbadmin reconfig\n\nIf no errors are found, use the lsload -l command to verify the value of your dynamic shared resources:\nHOST_NAME  status r15s  r1m  r15m  ut   pg   io  ls  it  tmp  swp  mem license1 license2\nhosta          ok  0.1  0.3  0.4   8%   0.2  50  73   0  62M  700M 425M       3        0 \nhostb          ok  0.1  0.1  0.4   4%   5.7   3   3   0  79M  204M  64M       3        0\nSubmit jobs that use shared resources\nTo submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource, use the command following command:\n% bsub -R 'rusage[license1=1:duration=1]' myjob\nIn the resource requirement (rusage) string, duration=1 means that license1 is reserved for 1 minute to give LSF time to check it out from FLEXlm.\nYou can also specify the resource requirement string at queue level, in the RES_REQ parameter for the queue. In the LSB_CONFDIR/cluster_name/configdir/lsb.queues file, specify the following resource requirement string:\nBegin Queue\nQUEUE_NAME = license1\nRES_REQ=rusage[license1=1:duration=1]\n...\nEnd Queue\nThen, submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource by using the following command:\n% bsub -q license1 myjob\nWhen licenses are available, LSF runs your jobs right away; when all licenses are in use, LSF puts your job in a queue and dispatches them as licenses become available. This way, all of your licenses are used to the best advantage.\nFor more information\n\nFor more information about the lsf.shared and lsf.cluster.cluster_name files and the parameters for configuring shared resources, see the Configuration Reference.\nFor more information about adding external resources to your cluster and configuring an ELIM to customize resources, see External load indices in Administering IBM Spectrum LSF. \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-22 09:57:34\n"},"chapter4/section3/troubleshooting_LSF_problems.html":{"url":"chapter4/section3/troubleshooting_LSF_problems.html","title":"4.3 LSF 排错","keywords":"","body":"4.3 LSF 排错\nTroubleshoot common LSF problems and understand LSF error messages.

Before you start to troubleshoot LSF problems, always check the error log files first. Log messages often point directly to the problem.\nFinding LSF error logs\nWhen something goes wrong, LSF server daemons log error messages in the LSF log directory (specified by the LSF_LOGDIR parameter in the lsf.conf file).\nProcedure\nMake sure that the primary LSF administrator owns LSF_LOGDIR, and that root can write to this directory.\nIf an LSF server is unable to write to LSF_LOGDIR, then the error logs are created in /tmp. LSF logs errors to the following files:\n\nlim.log.host_name\nres.log.host_name\npim.log.host_name\nmbatchd.log.master_host\nmbschd.log.master_host\nsbatchd.log.host_name\nvemkd.log.master_host\n\nIf these log files contain any error messages that you do not understand, contact IBM Support.\nDiagnosing and fixing most LSF problems\nGeneral troubleshooting steps for most LSF problems.\nProcedure\n\nRun the lsadmin ckconfig -v command and note any errors that are shown in the command output.\nLook for the error in one of the problems described in this section. If none of these troubleshooting steps applies to your situation, contact IBM Support.\n\nUse the following commands to restart the LSF cluster:\n# lsadmin limrestart all\n# lsadmin resrestart all\n# badmin hrestart all\n\nRun the ps -ef command to see whether the LSF daemons are running.\nLook for the processes similar to the following command output:\nroot 17426     1  0   13:30:40 ?    0:00 /opt/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/etc/lim\nroot 17436     1  0   13:31:11 ?    0:00 /opt/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/etc/sbatchd\nroot 17429     1  0   13:30:56 ?    0:00 /opt/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/etc/res\n\nCheck the LSF error logs on the first few hosts that are listed in the Host section of the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.cluster.cluster_name file.\nIf the LSF_MASTER_LIST parameter is defined in the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf file, check the error logs on the hosts that are listed in this parameter instead.\n\n\nCannot open lsf.conf file\nYou might see this message when you run the lsid file. The message usually means that the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf file is not accessible to LSF.\nAbout this task\nBy default, LSF checks the directory that is defined by the LSF_ENVDIR parameter for the lsf.conf file. If the lsf.conf file is not in LSF_ENVDIR, LSF looks for it in the /etc directory.\nFor more information, see Setting up the LSF environment with cshrc.lsf and profile.lsf.\nProcedure\n\nMake sure that a symbolic link exists from /etc/lsf.conf to lsf.conf\nUse the csrhc.lsf or profile.lsf script to set up your LSF environment.\nMake sure that the cshrc.lsf or profile.lsf script is available for users to set the LSF environment variables.\n\nLIM dies quietly\nWhen the LSF LIM daemon exits unexpectedly, check for errors in the LIM configuration files.\nProcedure\nRun the following commands:\nlsadmin ckconfig -v\nThis command displays most configuration errors. If the command does not report any errors, check in the LIM error log.\nLIM communication times out\nSometimes the LIM is up, but running the lsload command prints the following error message:Communication time out.\nAbout this task\nIf the LIM just started, LIM needs time to get initialized by reading configuration files and contacting other LIMs. If the LIM does not become available within one or two minutes, check the LIM error log for the host you are working on.\nTo prevent communication timeouts when the local LIM is starting or restarting, define the parameter LSF_SERVER_HOSTS in the lsf.conf file. The client contacts the LIM on one of the LSF_SERVER_HOSTS and runs the command. At least one of the hosts that are defined in the list must have a LIM that is up and running.\nWhen the local LIM is running but the cluster has no master, LSF applications display the following message:\nCannot locate master LIM now, try later.\nProcedure\nCheck the LIM error logs on the first few hosts that are listed in the Host section of the lsf.cluster.cluster_name file. If the LSF_MASTER_LIST parameter is defined in the lsf.conf file, check the LIM error logs on the hosts that are listed in this parameter instead.\nMaster LIM is down\nSometimes the master LIM is up, but running the lsload or lshosts command displays the following error message: Master LIM is down; try later.\nAbout this task\nIf the /etc/hosts file on the host where the master LIM is running is configured with the host name that is assigned to the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1), LSF client LIMs cannot contact the master LIM. When the master LIM starts up, it sets its official host name and IP address to the loopback address. Any client requests get the master LIM address as 127.0.0.1, and try to connect to it, and in fact tries to access itself.\nProcedure\nCheck the IP configuration of your master LIM in /etc/hosts.\nThe following example incorrectly sets the master LIM IP address to the loopback address:\n127.0.0.1   localhost   myhostname\nThe following example correctly sets the master LIM IP address:\n127.0.0.1    localhost\n192.168.123.123   myhostname\nFor a master LIM running on a host that uses an IPv6 address, the loopback address is\n::1\nThe following example correctly sets the master LIM IP address by using an IPv6 address:\n::1    localhost ipv6-localhost ipv6-loopback \n\nfe00::0     ipv6-localnet \n\nff00::0     ipv6-mcastprefix\nff02::1     ipv6-allnodes\nff02::2     ipv6-allrouters\nff02::3     ipv6-allhosts\nUser permission denied\nIf the remote host cannot securely determine the user ID of the user that is requesting remote execution, remote execution fails with the following error message: User permission denied..\nProcedure\n\nCheck the RES error log on the remote host for more detailed error message.\n\nIf you do not want to configure an identification daemon (LSF_AUTH in lsf.conf), all applications that do remote executions must be owned by root with the setuid bit set. Run the following command:\nchmod 4755 filename\n\nIf the application binary files are on an NFS-mounted file system, make sure that the file system is not mounted with the nosuid flag.\n\nIf you are using an identification daemon (the LSF_AUTH parameter in the lsf.conf file), the inetd daemon must be configured. The identification daemon must not be run directly.\n\nInconsistent host names in a name server with /etc/hosts and /etc/hosts.equiv can also cause this problem. If the LSF_USE_HOSTEQUIV parameter is defined in the lsf.conf file, check that the /etc/hosts.equiv file or the HOME/.rhosts file on the destination host has the client host name in it.\n\nFor Windows hosts, users must register and update their Windows passwords by using the lspasswd command. Passwords must be 3 characters or longer, and 31 characters or less.\nFor Windows password authentication in a non-shared file system environment, you must define the parameter LSF_MASTER_LIST in the lsf.conf file so that jobs run with correct permissions. If you do not define this parameter, LSF assumes that the cluster uses a shared file system environment.\n\n\nRemote execution fails because of non-uniform file name space\nA non-uniform file name space might cause a command to fail with the following error message: chdir(...) failed: no such file or directory.\nAbout this task\nYou are trying to run a command remotely, but either your current working directory does not exist on the remote host, or your current working directory is mapped to a different name on the remote host.\nIf your current working directory does not exist on a remote host, do not run commands remotely on that host.\nProcedure\n\nIf the directory exists, but is mapped to a different name on the remote host, you must create symbolic links to make them consistent.\n\nLSF can resolve most, but not all, problems by using automount. The automount maps must be managed through NIS.\nContact IBM Support if you are running automount and LSF is not able to locate directories on remote hosts.\n\n\nBatch daemons die quietly\nWhen the LSF batch daemons sbatchd and mbatchd exit unexpectedly, check for errors in the configuration files.\nAbout this task\nIf the mbatchd daemon is running but the sbatchd daemon dies on some hosts, it might be because mbatchd is not configured to use those hosts.\nProcedure\n\nCheck the sbatchd and mbatchd daemon error logs.\nRun the badmin ckconfig command to check the configuration.\nCheck for email in the LSF administrator mailbox.\n\nsbatchd starts but mbatchd does not\nWhen the sbatchd daemon starts but the mbatchd daemon is not running, it is possible that mbatchd is temporarily unavailable because the master LIM is temporarily unknown. The following error message is displayed: sbatchd: unknown service.\nProcedure\n\nRun the lsid command to check whether LIM is running.\nIf LIM is not running properly, follow the steps in the following topics to fix LIM problems:\n\nLIM dies quietly\nLIM communication times out\nMaster LIM is down\n\n\nCheck whether services are registered properly.\n\n\nAvoiding orphaned job processes\nLSF uses process groups to track all the processes of a job. However, if the application forks a child, the child becomes a new process group. The parent dies immediately, and the child process group is orphaned from the parent process, and cannot be tracked.\nAbout this task\nFor more information about process tracking with Linux cgroups, see Memory and swap limit enforcement based on Linux cgroup memory subsystem.\nProcedure\n\nWhen a job is started, the application runs under the job RES or root process group.\n\nIf an application creates a new process group, and its parent process ID (PPID) still belongs to the job, PIM can track this new process group as part of the job.\nThe only reliable way to not lose track of a process is to prevent it from using a new process group. Any process that daemonizes itself is lost when child processes are orphaned from the parent process group because it changes its process group right after it is detached.\n\n\nHost not used by LSF\nThe mbatchd daemon allows the sbatchd daemon to run only on the hosts that are listed in the Host section of the lsb.hosts file. If you configure an unknown host in the following configurations, mbatchd logs an error message: HostGroup or HostPartition sections of the lsb.hosts file, or as a HOSTS definition for a queue in the lsb.queues file.\nAbout this task\nIf you try to configure a host that is not listed in the Host section of the lsb.hosts file, the mbatchd daemon logs the following message.\nmbatchd on host: LSB_CONFDIR/cluster1/configdir/file(line #): Host hostname is not used by lsbatch; ignored\nIf you start the sbatchd daemon on a host that is not known by the mbatchd daemon, mbatchd rejects the sbatchd. The sbatchd daemon logs the following message and exits.\nThis host is not used by lsbatch system.\nProcedure\n\nAdd the unknown host to the list of hosts in the Host section of the lsb.hosts file.\n\nStart the LSF daemons on the new host.\n\nRun the following commands to reconfigure the cluster:\nlsadmin reconfig\nbadmin reconfig\n\n\nUNKNOWN host type or model\nA model or type UNKNOWN indicates that the host is down or the LIM on the host is down. You need to take immediate action to restart LIM on the UNKNOWN host.\nProcedure\n\nStart the host.\n\nRun the lshosts command to see which host has the UNKNOWN host type or model.\nlshosts\nHOST_NAME  type       model   cpuf   ncpus  maxmem   maxswp  server   RESOURCES \nhostA   UNKNOWN      Ultra2   20.2       2    256M    710M      Yes   ()\n\nRun the lsadmin limstartup command to start LIM on the host.\nlsadmin limstartup hostA\nStarting up LIM on  .... done\nIf EGO is enabled in the LSF cluster, you can run the following command instead:\negosh ego start lim hostA\nStarting up LIM on  .... done\nYou can specify more than one host name to start LIM on multiple hosts. If you do not specify a host name, LIM is started on the host from which the command is submitted.\nTo start LIM remotely on UNIX or Linux, you must be root or listed in the lsf.sudoers file (or the ego.sudoers file if EGO is enabled in the LSF cluster). You must be able to run the rsh command across all hosts without entering a password.\n\nWait a few seconds, then run the lshosts command again.\nThe lshosts command displays a specific model or type for the host or DEFAULT. If you see DEFAULT, it means that automatic detection of host type or model failed, and the host type that is configured in the lsf.shared file cannot be found. LSF works on the host, but a DEFAULT model might be inefficient because of incorrect CPU factors. A DEFAULT type might also cause binary incompatibility because a job from a DEFAULT host type can be migrated to another DEFAULT host type.\n\n\nDEFAULT host type or model\nIf you see DEFAULT in lim -t, it means that automatic detection of host type or model failed, and the host type that is configured in the lsf.shared file cannot be found. LSF works on the host, but a DEFAULT model might be inefficient because of incorrect CPU factors. A DEFAULT type might also cause binary incompatibility because a job from a DEFAULT host type can be migrated to another DEFAULT host type.\nProcedure\n\nRun the lshosts command to see which host has the DEFAULT host model or type.\nlshosts\nHOST_NAME     type    model     cpuf   ncpus  maxmem  maxswp   server  RESOURCES \nhostA     DEFAULT  DEFAULT        1       2    256M   710M       Yes  ()\nIf Model or Type are displayed as DEFAULT when you use the lshosts command and automatic host model and type detection is enabled, you can leave it as is or change it.\nIf the host model is DEFAULT, LSF works correctly but the host has a CPU factor of 1, which might not make efficient use of the host model.\nIf the host type is DEFAULT, there might be binary incompatibility. For example, if one host is Linux and another is AIX, but both hosts are set to type DEFAULT, jobs that are running on the Linux host might be migrated to the AIX host and vice versa, which might cause the job to file.\n\nRun lim -t on the host whose type is DEFAULT:\nlim -t\nHost Type             : NTX64\nHost Architecture     : EM64T_1596\nTotal NUMA Nodes      : 1\nTotal Processors      : 2\nTotal Cores           : 4\nTotal Threads         : 2\nMatched Type          : NTX64\nMatched Architecture  : EM64T_3000\nMatched Model         : Intel_EM64T\nCPU Factor            : 60.0\nNoteThe value of HostType and Host Architecture.\n\nEdit the lsf.shared file to configure the host type and host model for the host.\n\nIn the HostType section, enter a new host type. Use the host type name that is detected with the lim -t command.\nBegin HostType\nTYPENAME \nDEFAULT \nCRAYJ\nNTX64\n...\nEnd HostType\n\nIn the HostModel section, enter the new host model with architecture and CPU factor. Use the architecture that is detected with the lim -t commmand. Add the host model to the end of the host model list. The limit for host model entries is 127. Lines commented out with # are not counted in the 127-line limit.\nBegin HostModel\nMODELNAME   CPUFACTOR     ARCHITECTURE # keyword\nIntel_EM64T      20             EM64T_1596\nEnd HostModel\n\n\n\nSave changes to the lsf.shared file.\n\nRun the lsadmin reconfig command to reconfigure LIM.\n\nWait a few seconds, and run the lim -t command again to check the type and model of the host. \n\n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-14 09:24:41\n"},"chapter4/section3/LSF_error_messages.html":{"url":"chapter4/section3/LSF_error_messages.html","title":"LSF 错误信息","keywords":"","body":"LSF 错误信息\nThe following error messages are logged by the LSF daemons, or displayed by the lsadmin ckconfig and badmin ckconfig commands.\nGeneral errors\nThe following messages can be generated by any LSF daemon:\n\ncan’t open file: error\nThe daemon might not open the named file for the reason that is given by error.

Scheduler (LSF License Scheduler) makes it easy to share licenses between project teams and departments within the same design center or around the globe. With tools to allocate and monitor licenses, license owners can share licenses not in use, while still ensuring immediate access to licenses when needed. With more effective sharing, all users perceive a larger pool of licenses.\n确保适当的许可证分配\nLicense Scheduler enables flexible, hierarchical sharing policies that reflect the needs of the business. During quiet periods, when licenses are not in contention, licenses can be allocated to anyone who needs them keeping utilization and throughput high. During busy periods, the supply of licenses can be allocated based on policy toward the most time or revenue critical projects.\n提高服务水平和生产力\nBy ensuring access to a minimum share of licenses and enabling allocation to flex between clusters that are based on need, licenses are more readily available and jobs are less likely to pend in queues that are awaiting license resources. This translates into reduced wait times and better productivity, and contributes to a faster, more efficient design environment.\n减少或避免成本\nBy being able to allocate scarce licenses to the most critical projects, and by being able to analyze license usage in the context of cluster resources, users and projects, planners are better able to find and remove bottlenecks, making their existing licenses more productive. With better visibility to how licenses are being used, they can plan license requirements more effectively ultimately helping to contain costs and boost productivity.\nLicense Scheduler controls the software license sharing in your organization. License Scheduler works with FlexNet™ and Reprise License Manager™ products to control and monitor license usage.\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-27 09:23:17\n"},"chapter10/section1/Differences between LSF License Scheduler editions.html":{"url":"chapter10/section1/Differences between LSF License Scheduler editions.html","title":"LSF License Scheduler 版本之间的差异","keywords":"","body":"LSF License Scheduler 版本之间的差异\nLSF License Scheduler is available in two editions: Basic Edition and Standard Edition.\nLSF License Scheduler Basic Edition is included with LSF Standard Edition and Advanced Edition, and is not intended to apply policies on how licenses are shared between clusters or projects.

Using LSF License Scheduler, jobs receive a license token before starting the application. The number of tokens available from IBM Spectrum LSF (LSF) andIBM Spectrum LSF Advanced Edition (LSF Advanced Edition) corresponds to the number of licenses available from the license server, so if a token is not available, the job does not start. In this way, the number of licenses that are requested by running jobs does not exceed the number of available licenses.\nWhen a job starts, the application is not aware of LSF License Scheduler. The application checks out licenses from the license server in the usual manner.\nFigure 1. Daemon interaction\n调度策略如何工作\nWith LSF License Scheduler, LSF gathers information about the licensing requirements of pending jobs to efficiently distribute available licenses. Other LSF scheduling policies are independent from LSF License Scheduler policies.\nThe basic LSF scheduling comes first when starting a job. LSF License Scheduler has no influence on job scheduling priority. Jobs are considered for dispatch according to the prioritization policies configured in each cluster.\nFor example, a job must have a candidate LSF host on which to start before the LSF License Scheduler fairshare policy (for the license project this job belongs to) applies.\nOther LSF fairshare policies are based on CPU time, run time, and usage. If LSF fairshare scheduling is configured, LSFdetermines which user or queue has the highest priority, then considers other resources. In this way, the other LSF fairshare policies have priority over LSF License Scheduler.\n当 mbatchd 脱机时\nWhen a cluster is running, the mbatchd maintains a TCP connection to bld. When the cluster is disconnected (such as when the cluster goes down or is restarted), the bld removes all information about jobs in the cluster. LSF License Scheduler considers licenses that are checked out by jobs in a disconnected cluster to be non-LSF use of licenses.\nWhen mbatchd comes back online, the bld immediately receives updated information about the number of tokens that are currently distributed to the cluster.\n当 bld 脱机时\nIf the mbatchd loses the connection with the bld, the mbatchd cannot get bld’s token distribution decisions to update its own.\nHowever, because the mbatchd logs token status every minute in$LSF_TOP/work/data/featureName.ServiceDomainName.dat file, if the connection is lost, the mbatchd uses the last logged information to schedule jobs.\nf3.LanServer1.dat \n# f3 LanServer1 3 2\n# p1 50 p2 50  \n  12/3         14:20:38        2    0    2    0         1    0    1    0    \n  12/3         14:21:39        2    0    2    0         1    0    1    0    \n  12/3         14:22:40        3    3    0    0         0    0    0    0    \n  12/3         14:23:41        3    3    0    0         0    0    0    0    \n  12/3         14:24:42        1    0    1    0         2    0    2    0    \n  12/3         14:25:43        1    0    1    0         2    0    2    0    \n  12/3         14:26:44        1    0    1    0         2    0    2    0    \n  12/3         14:27:55        1    0    1    0         2    0    2    0\n\nf3 on LanServer1 has three tokens and two projects.

Both project mode and cluster mode can be configured in one installation, however, all different licenses that are required by a job must belong to the same mode.\n\ncluster mode\nDistributes license tokens to clusters, where LSF scheduling takes over.Cluster mode emphasizes high utilization of license tokens over other considerations such as ownership. License ownership and sharing can still be configured, but within each cluster instead of across multiple clusters. Preemption of jobs (and licenses) also occurs within each cluster instead of across clusters.License tokens are reused by LSF when a job finishes, without waiting for confirmation from lmstat or rlmstat that license tokens are available and reported in the next blcollect cycle. This results in higher license utilization for short jobs.Cluster mode was introduced in License Scheduler 8.0.\n\nproject mode\nDistributes license token to projects configured across all clusters.Project mode emphasizes ownership of license tokens by specific projects which span multiple clusters. When License Scheduler is running in project mode, License Scheduler checks demand from license owners across all LSF clusters before allocating license tokens in project mode. The process of collecting and evaluating demand for all projects in all clusters slows down each scheduling cycle. License tokens are distributed in the next scheduling cycle after lmstat or rlmstat confirms license token availability.Project mode was the only choice available before License Scheduler 8.0.\n\n\nDifference between cluster mode and project mode\nThe following figure illustrates license utilization in cluster mode for short jobs with the corresponding lmstat or rlmstat reporting times:\n\nIn cluster mode, when one job finishes running, the next job gets its license immediately without having to wait for the next lmstat or rlmstat interval. For example, four jobs that require license 2 are able to run without waiting for lmstat or rlmstat to report token distribution.\nThe following figure illustrates license utilization in project mode for short jobs with the lmstat or rlmstat reporting times:\n\nIn project mode, each job must wait for lmstat or rlmstat to report token distribution before it can get a license and start running. In this example, three jobs that require license 2 are able to start within the lmstat or rlmstat intervals illustrated.\nWhen to use cluster mode\nCluster mode is most appropriate for your needs if:\n\nYour primary goal is to maximize license use.\nOwnership of licenses is a secondary consideration.\nMany jobs are short relative to the blcollect cycle (60 seconds by default, set by LM_STAT_INTERVAL).\n\nWhen to use project mode\nProject mode is most appropriate for your needs if the following applies:\n\nYour primary goal is to ensure ownership of the group.\nMaximizing license use is a secondary consideration.\nMost jobs are long relative to the blcollect cycle (60 seconds by default, set by LM_STAT_INTERVAL). \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-27 09:18:31\n"},"chapter10/section3/Project groups.html":{"url":"chapter10/section3/Project groups.html","title":"项目组","keywords":"","body":"Project groups\nWhen you are configuring your installation of License Scheduler in project mode, you can choose to configure projects, or extend your project configuration further to form hierarchical project groups.\nProject groups pool multiple service domains together and treat them as one source for licenses, and distribute them in a hierarchical fairshare tree. The leaves of the policy tree are the license projects that jobs can belong to. Each project group in the tree has a set of values, including shares and limits.\nLicense ownership is applied at the leaf level; that is, on individual license projects. Ownership of a given internal node equals to sum of the ownership of all of its direct children.\nEach feature has its own hierarchical group, but features can share hierarchy. The hierarchical scheduling is done per feature across service domains.\n\nprojects\nProjects alone apply one distribution policy within one service domain. The same local distribution policy can be applied to more than one service domain, but is implemented locally.\n\ngroups of projects\nGroups of projects apply one distribution policy within one service domain, but assign shares and ownership to groups of projects for greater flexibility. With group license ownership, projects trigger preemption either when the project is using fewer licenses than it owns or when the group to which the project belongs is using fewer licenses than the group owns.\n\nproject groups\nProjects groups apply one distribution policy across multiple service domains following the configured hierarchical structure. You can also use project groups to apply hard limits to the number of licenses that are distributed to each project.After configuration, the same project group hierarchy can be used for more than one feature.\n\n\nWhen to use groups of projects\nGrouping projects together in project mode is most appropriate for your needs if:\n\nLicenses are owned at multiple levels, for example by a department and also by projects within the department.\nLicense ownership is within one service domain. As for ungrouped projects, distribution policies are implemented locally for groups of projects.\n\nWhen to use project groups\nExtending your configuration to include project groups is most appropriate for your needs if:\n\nLicense ownership spans service domains.\nOne distribution policy must be applied across several service domains.\nProject limits must be applied across clusters.\n\nNoteIf required, use LSF to configure license project limits within one cluster. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-27 09:18:44\n"},"chapter10/section3/Service domains in License Scheduler.html":{"url":"chapter10/section3/Service domains in License Scheduler.html","title":"License Scheduler 中的服务域","keywords":"","body":"Service domains in License Scheduler\nA service domain is a group of one or more license servers. License Scheduler manages the scheduling of the license tokens, but the license server actually supplies the licenses. You configure the service domain with the license server names and port numbers that serve licenses to a network.\n\nLAN: a service domain that serves licenses to a single cluster\nWAN: a sevice domain that serves licenses to multiple clusters\n\nLicense Scheduler assumes that any license in the service domain is available to any user who can receive a token from License Scheduler. Therefore, every user that is associated with a project specified in the distribution policy must meet the following requirements:\n\nThe user is able to make a network connection to every license server host in the service domain.\nThe user environment is configured with permissions to check out the license from every license server host in the service domain.\n\nYou must configure at least one service domain for License Scheduler. It groups license server hosts that serve licenses to LSF jobs and is used when you define a policy for sharing software licenses among your projects.\nIf a license server is not part of a License Scheduler service domain, its licenses are not managed by License Scheduler (the license distribution policies you configure in LSF do not apply to these licenses and usage of these licenses does not influence LSF scheduling decisions).\nService domain locality\nYou can use license feature locality to limit features from different service domains to a specific cluster so that License Scheduler does not grant tokens to jobs from license that legally cannot be used on the cluster that requested the token. The LAN service domains that are used in cluster mode are configured with single-cluster locality.\nProject mode\nIn project mode, a cluster can access the same license feature from multiple service domains.\nIf your license servers restrict the serving of license tokens to specific geographical locations, use LOCAL_TO to specify the locality of a license token for any features that cannot be shared across all the locations. This parameter avoids having to define different distribution and allocation policies for different service domains, and allows hierarchical project group configurations.\nTo use License Scheduler tokens in project mode, a job submission must specify the -Lp (license project) option. The project must be defined for the requested feature in lsf.licensescheduler.\nCluster mode\nIn cluster mode, each license feature in a cluster can access a single license feature from at most one WAN and one LAN service domain.\nLicense Scheduler does not control application checkout behavior. If the same license is available from both the LAN and WAN service domains, License Scheduler expects jobs to try to obtain the license from the LAN first.\nParallel jobs\nWhen LSF dispatches a parallel job, LSF License Scheduler attempts to check out user@host keys in the parallel job constructed using the user name and all execution host names, and merges the corresponding checkout information on the service domain if found.\nFor example, in project mode, for feature F1 with two projects (P1 and P2) in service domain sd1, with ten tokens, a parallel job is dispatched to four execution hosts using the following command:\nbsub -n 4 -Lp P1 -R \"rusage[F1=4]\" mycmd\nThe job on each execution host checks out one F1 license from the sd1 service domain. If the four execution hosts are hostA, hostB, hostC, and hostD, there are checkout keys for user@hostA, user@hostB, user@hostC, and user@hostD, and each entry contributes corresponds with one token checked out. These tokens all merge into data for the P1 project in the F1 feature. Therefore, running blstat displays the following information for the F1 feature:\nFEATURE: F1\n SERVICE_DOMAIN: LanServer\n TOTAL_INUSE: 4    TOTAL_RESERVE: 0    TOTAL_FREE: 6    OTHERS: 0\n  PROJECT                 SHARE     OWN       INUSE     RESERVE   FREE      DEMAND\n  P1                      50.0 %    0         4         0         1         0\n  P2                      50.0 %    0         0         0         5         0\nThe four checkout keys from the four execution hosts are merged into the P1 project.\nIf MERGE_BY_SERVICE_DOMAIN=Y is defined, LSF License Scheduler also merges multiple user@host data for parallel jobs across different service domains.\nFor example, if you have the same setup as the previous example, but with an additional service domain sd2 also with two projects (P1 and P2) and ten tokens, and you have MERGE_BY_SERVICE_DOMAIN=Y defined, running blstat displays the following information for the F1 feature:\nblstat\nFEATURE: F1\n SERVICE_DOMAIN: sd1\n TOTAL_INUSE: 2    TOTAL_RESERVE: 0    TOTAL_FREE: 8    OTHERS: 0\n  PROJECT                 SHARE     OWN       INUSE     RESERVE   FREE      DEMAND\n  P1                      50.0 %    0         2         0         3         0\n  P2                      50.0 %    0         0         0         5         0\n SERVICE_DOMAIN: sd2\n TOTAL_INUSE: 2    TOTAL_RESERVE: 0    TOTAL_FREE: 8    OTHERS: 0\n  PROJECT                 SHARE     OWN       INUSE     RESERVE   FREE      DEMAND\n  P1                      50.0 %    0         2         0         3         0\n  P2                      50.0 %    0         0         0         5         0\nTwo checkout keys are merged into the P1 project in the sd1 domain, while two checkout keys are merged into the P1 project under the sd2 domain.\nIf CHECKOUT_FROM_FIRST_HOST_ONLY=Y is defined, LSF License Scheduler only considers user@host information for the first execution host of a parallel job when merging the license usage data. Setting in individual Feature sections overrides the global setting in the Parameters section.\nIf a feature has multiple Feature sections (using LOCAL_TO), each section must have the same setting for CHECKOUT_FROM_FIRST_HOST_ONLY. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-27 09:19:03\n"},"chapter10/section3/Distribution policies.html":{"url":"chapter10/section3/Distribution policies.html","title":"发行政策","keywords":"","body":"Distribution policies\nThe most important part of License Scheduler is license token distribution. The license distribution policy determines how license tokens are shared among projects or clusters. Whenever there is competition, the configured share assignment determines the portion of license tokens each project or cluster is entitled to.\nWe refer to both licenses and license tokens because License Scheduler does not control licenses directly. Instead, it controls the dispatch of jobs that require licenses that are submitted through LSF or taskman by tracking license tokens.\nTotal license tokens\nThe total number of license tokens that are managed by License Scheduler for a single feature in one service domain depends on the following factors:\n\nThe number of active license servers in the service domain\nThe number of licenses that are checked out by applications that are not managed by LSF\n\nLicense shares\nLicense shares that are assigned in the distribution policy determine what portion of total licenses a project (in project mode) or cluster (in cluster mode) receives. Each project or cluster able to use a license feature must have a share of the license feature in the service domain.\nThe formula for converting a number of shares to a number of licenses for any license feature is:\n(shares assigned to project or cluster)\n______________________________          x (total number of licenses) \n(sum of all shares assigned)\nThe number of shares that are assigned to a license project or cluster is only meaningful when you compare it to the number assigned to other projects or clusters, or to the total number of shares.\nWhen there are no jobs in the system, each project or cluster is assigned license tokens that are based on share assignments.\nParent topic:\nLSF License Scheduler concepts\nCluster mode distribution policies\n\nstatic\nA portion of the total licenses is allocated to the cluster based on the configured share. The amount is static, and does not depend on the workload in the system.\n\ndynamic\nShares of the total licenses are assigned to each cluster, along with a buffer size. The configured shares set the number of licenses each cluster receives initially, but this number is adjusted regularly based on demand from the cluster.License distribution changes whenever a cluster requests an allocation update, by default every 15 seconds. In each update, the allocation can increase by as much as the buffer size. There is no restriction on decreasing cluster allocation.When dynamic license distribution is used in cluster mode, minimum and maximum allocation values can be configured for each cluster. The minimum allocation is like the number of non-shared licenses for project mode, as this number of tokens is reserved for the exclusive use of the cluster.If the minimum value configured exceeds the share assignment for the cluster, only the assigned share is reserved for the cluster.Cluster shares take precedence over minimum allocations configured. If the minimum allocation exceeds the cluster's share of the total tokens, a cluster's allocation as given by bld may be less than the configured minimum allocation.\n\nguarantees within a cluster\nGuaranteed shares of licenses are assigned to projects within a cluster that use LSF guarantee-type SLAs. Optionally, sharing of guaranteed licenses not in use can be configured.Guarantees are like ownership for cluster mode, and can be used with both static and dynamic distribution policies.NoteGuarantee-type SLAs are only available in LSF version 8.0 or newer.\n\n\nWhen to use static license distribution\nConfigure shares for all license features in cluster mode. Static license distribution is the basic license distribution policy, and is built on by adding more configuration.\nThe basic static configuration can meet your needs if the demand for licenses across clusters is predictable and unchanging, or licenses are strictly owned by clusters, or you always have extra licenses.\nWhen to use dynamic license distribution\nDynamic license allocation can meet your needs if the demand for licenses changes across clusters.\nWhen to use LSF guarantee SLAs with License Scheduler\nConfiguring guarantee SLAs within LSF clusters can meet your needs if the licenses within a cluster are owned, and used either preferentially or exclusively by the license owners.\nProject mode distribution policies\n\nfairshare\nShares of the total licenses are assigned to each license project.Unused licenses are shared wherever there is demand, however, when demand exceeds the number of licenses, share assignments are followed. Jobs are not preempted to redistribute licenses; instead licenses are redistributed when jobs finish running.\n\nownership and preemption\nShares of the total licenses are assigned to each license project. Owned shares of licenses are also assigned.Unused licenses are shared wherever there is demand, however, when demand exceeds the number of licenses, the owned share is reclaimed using preemption.Preemption occurs only while the specified number of owned licenses are not yet in use, and no free licenses are available. Once all owned licenses are used, License Scheduler waits for licenses to become free (instead of using preemption) and then distributes more tokens until the share is reached.Jobs that are preempted by License Scheduler are automatically resumed once licenses become available.By default, LSF releases the job slot of a suspended job when License Scheduler preempts the license from the job.NoteFor License Scheduler to give a license token to another project, the applications must be able to release their licenses upon job suspension.\n\nactive ownership\nActive ownership allows ownership to automatically adjust based on project activity. Ownership is expressed as a percent of the total ownership for active projects. The actual ownership for each project decreases as more projects become active. Set percentage ownership values to total more than 100% to benefit from active ownership.\n\nnon-shared licenses\nSome licenses are designated as non-shared, and are reserved for exclusive use instead of being shared when not in use.The number of non-shared licenses is contained by the number of owned licenses, but this number is not included in share calculations for the project. To designate some licenses as non-shared, add the non-shared number to both the owned and the non-shared values.\n\n\nWhen to use fairshare with project mode\nConfigure fairshare for all license features in project mode. Fairshare is the basic license distribution policy, and is built on by adding additional configuration.\nThe basic fairshare configuration can meet your needs without configuring additional distribution policies if the licenses are assigned to specific license projects, but not strictly owned.\nWhen to add ownership (and preemption)\nConfigure licenses as owned when:\n\nLicenses are owned by licenses projects, but can be loaned out when not in use.\nMaximizing license usage and license ownership are both important considerations. Loaned licenses must be returned to the owners as quickly as possible when needed (using preemption).\nJobs borrowing licenses can be preempted.\n\nWhen to add active ownership\nConfigure active ownership for owned licenses when:\n\nOwnership values are dynamic instead of being fixed values, and usually decrease as more projects actively seek licenses.\n\nWhen to add non-shared licenses\nConfigure licenses as non-shared when:\n\nLicenses are owned.\nLicenses are used exclusively by the owners.\nHaving licenses always available to the owners is more important than maximizing license use. \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-27 10:16:50\n"},"chapter10/section3/subsection1/Project mode
