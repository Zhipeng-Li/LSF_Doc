LSF: 高效的集群管理系统\n计算机通过执行程序，帮助科研人员进行科学研究。通常，计算机的使用者不关心程序的执行过程，他们只希望更快更有效地获取运算结果。而为了提供强大的计算能力，大量的计算资源以集群的形式出现。集群系统的使用和有效管理都面临着挑战。\nLSF（Load Sharing Facility）是一款分布式集群管理系统软件，负责计算资源的管理和批处理作业的调度。它给用户提供统一的集群资源访问接口，让用户透明地访问整个集群资源。同时提供了丰富的功能和可定制的策略。LSF 具有良好的可伸缩性和高可用性，支持几乎所有的主流操作系统。它通常是高性能计算环境中不可或缺的基础软件。\nLSF 虽然是一款商业软件，但它同时也提供免费的社区版供大家下载和使用。\n简单的使用\nLSF 的使用者可以大约分为两类，普通用户和集群系统管理员。普通用户可以通过命令，将计算程序提交给集群执行，获取计算结果。系统管理员可以通过配置文件和管理命令，管理集群以及统计计算资源的使用情况。\n图 1. LSF 结构图\n\n普通用户提交可执行程序或脚本给 LSF。LSF 将已提交的程序称为作业。作业在LSF 的队列 (Queue) 里排队 (PEND) ，等待调度。\n清单 1.  提交作业\nlsfrhel01 # bsub –R \"linux\" sleep 1000\nJob  is submitted to default queue .\nlsfrhel01 # bjobs\nJOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME\n1       tom     PEND  normal     lsfrhel01               *eep 1000  May  9 15:42\n\nLSF 根据配置的调度策略，把作业分配到最合适的计算节点上执行 (RUN) 。用户可以通过命令行查看，控制作业的执行过程。除此之外，LSF 还为用户提供了作业修改，需求描述，作业控制等多种命令行工具。\n清单 2. 查看运行作业\nlsfrhel01 # bjobs\nJOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME\n1       tom     RUN   normal     lsfrhel01   lsfrhel02   *eep 1000  May  9 15:42\n\n系统管理员通常需要了解整个集群系统中作业和资源的使用状况，LSF 提供的命令帮助管理员快速直观地看到系统概况：系统中队列的状态，机器的状态，作业的资源使用概况，等等。除此之外，LSF 还为管理员提供了丰富的集群配置，控制，管理等功能。\n清单 3. 查看 LSF 系统信息\nlsfrhel01 # bqueues normal\nQUEUE_NAME      PRIO STATUS          MAX JL/U JL/P JL/H NJOBS  PEND   RUN  SUSP\nnormal           30  Open:Active       -    -

Host）。它们既可以提交作业，也可以执行作业。按照职能的不同，服务节点可以有不同的身份。管理作业调度资源的节点称为主节点（Master host），一个集群只有一个主节点。对于一次作业提交来说，提交作业的节点为提交节点（Submission host），被分配并执行作业的节点是执行节点（Execution host）。\n图 2. 节点角色\n\n为了便于机器的管理，LSF 提供节点组（Host group）的概念。任意的机器集合可以被作为整体命名，通过名字在集群范围内整体引用。一种典型的用法是将节点按照内存大小进行分类：大内存节点组和小内存节点组。不同的作业可以请求不同的节点组，LSF 按照请求，分配该节点组中的机器来执行作业。节点组还有一个灵活的特性：为方便管理，同一台机器可以定义到不同的节点组。\n图 3. 节点分组\n\n作业占用机器资源进行计算。每一个机器被划分成若干个槽位（slot） 。每一个槽位通常可以容纳一个作业运行。 通常情况下，每一个槽位和一个CPU 核心（core）相对应。槽位是一个容易混淆的概念，为便于理解，可以将槽位等同于CPU 核心来看待。对于并行作业来说，比如MPI 作业，每一个都需要占用更多的槽位加速计算。\n作业的管理是以队列（Queue）为单位的，调度的策略也是按照队列定制的。作为作业的容器，可以配置多个队列定制不同策略。LSF 按照队列的优先级，从高到低调度每一个队列中的作业，为其分配资源。高优先级队列的作业对资源的使用具有优先权。\n图 4. 调度方式\n\n　　\n用户是作业提交者，也是资源的真正使用者。对于资源和作业的管理，不少策略都是以用户为单位。为了更好管理用户，LSF 引入用户组（user group）。若干用户集合可以统一命名，并使用该命名统一引用。例如，一个人属于一个部门，一个部门可以作为一个用户组，这种情况下就可以使用部门名字命名和引用。\n体系结构\nLSF 采用传统的客户机服务器模式，主节点负责整个集群的管理，从节点负责管理运行其上的作业的管理。每一个服务节点包含三个后台进程：\n\nSbatchd\n\n批处理作业管理进程。负责在本节点上执行作业，监控作业状态以及收集其使用的资源。同时根据用户请求或者系统策略触发，控制作业的状态，比如发送SIGSTOP 给作业、挂起作业运行等。\n\nRES\n\n远程执行服务进程。负责执行远程客户请求的任务，主要用于并行作业的远程任务启动、监控以及控制。\n\nLIM\n\n采集本节点的负载信息进程。将收集到的资源负载信息周期上报给主节点上的LIM。主节点的LIM 拥有整个集群资源状态，为其它服务提供集群系统范围内的资源当前快照。\n主管理节点在这个基础上，包括两个额外的进程：\n\nMbatchd\n\n集群管理服务进程。它是 LSF 的中心：通过主节点的 LIM 获取机器以及相关资源信息，处理远程用户的作业提交请求，委托 mbschd 将作业调度到相关资源上，发送调度结果到指定机器，并通过和 sbatchd 的交互，监控作业使用的资源，控制作业的执行过程。\n\nMbschd\n\n调度策略服务进程。从 mbachd 获取作业和资源信息，根据定制策略，为 mbatchd 提供作业调度服务。\n图 5. 体系结构\n\n当一个新作业提交的时候，集群管理服务进程检查作业的合法性，并将作业放入到指定的队列中等待调度。经过调度的作业，将获得执行机器上的slot、内存等资源。LSF 负责保留相关资源并将作业指派到已分配机器上执行。作业的状态和实际使用的资源通过批处理作业管理进程报告给集群管理进程。\n集群系统构建在分布式网络节点上，节点的失效和网路设备的故障都会导致集群系统的基础环境改变。集群系统的高可用性功能可以保证即使在底层设备故障，LSF 系统仍然可以提供可靠稳定的服务。LSF 采用主备模式实现系统的故障恢复。LSF 的主节点将运行时事件信息写入网络文件系统。当主节点失效后，相关备节点进行选举，选出新的主节点。新的主节点从事件信息文件中恢复作业信息、机器状态，最终获取集群控制权，恢复LSF 状态。\n为了更进一步扩展 LSF 的资源管理范围和方式，在单一集群基础上，LSF 还提供多集群互联技术（Multi-Cluster）。多集群通过互联，共享跨集群资源，提供更强大的计算能力。下面是一种典型的多集群架构，集群 1 负责接收作业提交和转发，集群 2 和 集群 3 负责作业执行。\n图 6. 多集群结构\n\n资源调度\nLSF 收集每一个节点的处理器、内存、交换区、临时存储区等资源信息。主节点掌握全局资源信息。资源的管理和调度以这些信息为基础。\n清单 4. 查看节点资源负载信息\nlsfrhel01 # lshosts\nHOST_NAME      type    model  cpuf ncpus

2     1 2391M  1.2G  603M\n\n作业在使用资源的时候，主要考虑三个方面：如何根据作业的资源描述选择合适的执行机器，如何预留机器资源减少运行时的资源竞争，以及如何限制作业对资源的使用避免作业过度消耗资源。\n首先是选择执行机。每一个作业会有不同的资源需求。可以通过 LSF 定义的资源描述模式请求资源，运行节点由LSF 根据作业对资源描述来匹配。当一个作业需要一定量内存的时候，\"select[mem>512]\" 表示选择内存大于512M 的机器来运行作业。调度器为其选择拥有合适资源的机器。\n其次是确保执行机上的资源分配。既然我们选择了大内存的机器，那么别人的作业也可以选择大内存的机器。如果很多作业都在大内存机器上运行，资源竞争会导致内存短缺，作业最终无法占用到请求的资源。为了更好的确保资源，我们需要在作业运行时保留这些资源不会再分配给别人的作业。\"rusage[mem=512]\" 表示保留 512M                内存给作业，节点当前可用内存将会有 512M 分配给该作业，节点可分配资源将减少512M 的内存。通过 LSF                的策略，可用内存的分配得到控制，已经保留的内存将不会再分配给其它的作业。\n最后是保证资源不被过度消耗。资源的保留是通过 LSF 的策略保证，但是作业的进程在运行时，却尚未受 LSF                控制。我们需要在执行节点上，对作业的系统资源设置限制，保证作业（进程）本身不会吃掉过多的内存。通常我们可以设置一个资源上限，防止作业过度消耗资源。比如，内存限制 '1024M'，防止作业使用超过1G 的内存。\n清单 5. 提交内存需求的作业\n$ bsub -M 1024 -R \"select[mem>512] rusage[mem=512]\" sleep 1000\nJob  is

CPU、交换区、临时目录大小等等。虽然这些默认管理的资源始终是有限的，但是 LSF 还提供了资源管理的扩展机制。用户可以统过编写自己的 ELIM 来收集自定义的资源。比如，收集系统的网络带宽以及网络负载，作业可以通过资源描述，选择拥有相应带宽的节点执行作业。资源的种类很多，LSF 提供布尔类型、字符串类型和数字类型来描述多种多样的资源。\n定制策略\nLSF 提供了非常丰富的调度策略供 LSF 系统管理员选择配置。策略针对作业和资源，从提高资源利用率、优化资源分配、提高用户满意度等各个方面为资源的使用者和管理者提供可配置策略。\n默认的策略是先来先服务（FCFS）。顾名思义，先提交的作业先调度，优先获得资源。排在后面的作业必须等待前面的作业运行完成才能开始。后提交作业可能在很长时间得不到机会运行。考虑到资源分配的公平问题，比如部门之间应该平等使用资源，公平共享（Fairshare）策略得以引入。通过配置以部门为单位的用户组平等分享资源，不同用户的作业优先考虑资源所有权。避免了先来先服务导致的资源不平等，从而优化资源分配。\n公平共享是从资源分配公平性上考虑问题的，它达到的是一个最终资源使用公平的平衡。但是在使用过程中，如果其他人或者部门没有作业，那么整个集群的资源将会被分配给目前已经提交的作业。作业执行期间，即便新的作业拥有更多的资源优先使用权，也要等待其他作业执行完毕，释放资源后才能执行。这样在短时期内资源使用是不公平的。对于拥有资源使用权却无法执行的情况，资源保障（Resource Guarantee）策略可以为用户保留资源，随时可用。这是在牺牲资源利用率基础上提高用户满意度。\n对于并行作业，通常要求很多的 slot，当系统资源紧张的时候，即使等待很久依然无法运行。当系统释放一个 slot                的时候，这个作业因为发现资源不够，便放弃对资源的优先权。排在后面的只需要一个 slot 的作业将获取资源执行。这个过程反复着，并行作业始终无法获取足够资源。为了解决这个问题引入了资源保留策略。虽然当前资源不够运行的，但是这个资源暂时被并行作业占有，等待后面不断释放的资源，直到 slot 满足作业的需求。\n但是长时间的等待还是会浪费这些空闲资源，因此又加入回填策略。在不影响并行作业启动时间的前提下，可以将短作业优先调度到已经被保留的 slot 上。\n对于特权或者紧急的用户或者应用，当系统资源完全使用的时候。为了尽快执行，抢占（Preemption）策略可以通过抢占已执行作业的资源，执行自己的作业。\n除此之外，为了满足用户需求，LSF 提供了资源预留（Advanced Reservation）、SLA 等等。为了提高资源利用率，LSF 提供了NUMA绑定（Affinity）策略等等。对于详尽的策略，可以参考 LSF 管理员手册。LSF 的很多策略都可以自由组合，通过管理员的配置，最终形成丰富的，满足各种需求的定制策略。\n即便所有的策略都不能满足你的要求，LSF 的调度策略还实现了插件机制。新的扩展可以通过 LSF 提供的API 实现新的策略。\n总结\n在高性能计算领域，作业管理系统是一种成熟的系统软件技术。LSF 作为其中的佼佼者，提供了统一的访问接口，丰富的调度策略，灵活的配置和部署。LSF 的体系结构和部署方式让它可以有效管理一定规模的集群系统，目前商业版可以支持多达数千台节点和数百万作业的管理。LSF 的故障恢复机制足以保证集群系统的高可用性。在分布式计算技术不断发展的今天，作为传统的批处理管理软件，依然发挥着重要的作用。\n参考资源\n\n下载 IBM Spectrum LSF Community Edition，安装，试用LSF 的基本功能\n参考 IBM Spectrum

可以容许集群中，任何主机或主机组的故障。当某主机不可用时，在该主机上运行的所有作业，将会重新排队运行或丢失，具体取决于该作业是否被标记为可重新运行。其他挂起或正在运行的作业，则不会受到影响。\n故障转移的工作原理\n容错能力取决于事件日志文件 lsb.events，该文件保存在主文件服务器上。系统中的每个事件都记录在该文件中，包括所有作业提交以及作业和主机状态更改。如果主节点不可用，则从主节点候选列表中选择一个新的主节点，新的主节点上的 sbatchd 守护程序，将启动一个新的 mbatchd 守护程序。 新的 mbatchd 守护程序，会读取lsb.events 文件以恢复系统状态。\n重复事件记录\n对于不希望仅依靠中央文件服务器获取恢复信息的站点，可以将 LSF 配置为通过保留 lsb.events 文件的副本来维护重复的事件日志。 副本存储在文件服务器上，并且在主副本不可用时使用。 启用重复事件日志记录后，主事件日志将本地存储在第一个主主机上，并在主机恢复时与复制的副本重新同步。\n主机故障转移\nLSF 主节点是动态选择的。如果当前的主节点不可用，则另一台主机将自动接管。故障转移主机，是从  lsf.conf 文件（在安装时在 install.config 文件中指定）的 LSF_MASTER_LIST 参数中定义的列表中选择的。列表中的第一个可用节点充当主机。\n正在运行的作业由每个服务器主机上的 sbatchd 守护程序管理。 当新的 mbatchd 守护程序启动时，它将轮询每个主机上的 sbatchd 守护程序，并找到其作业状态。如果 sbatchd 守护程序失效，但主机仍在运行，则主机上正在运行的作业不会丢失。 重新启动 sbatchd 守护程序后，它将重新获得对主机上正在运行的所有作业的控制。\n作业故障转移\n作业可以通过可重新运行的方式来提交，如此一来，它们可以从头开始自动运行，也可以通过可检查点的形式提交，如此一来，如果由于主机故障而挂掉，则可以从另一个主机上的检查点重新开始。\n如果集群中的所有主机都关闭，则所有正在运行的作业都将丢失。 当主节点的候选节点，恢复并接管为主节点时，它将读取 lsb.events 文件，以获取所有批处理作业的状态。  除非系统将其标记为可重新运行，否则系统关闭时，正在运行的作业将被认为已退出，并且电子邮件将发送给提交用户。等待的作业则保留在队列中，并在主机可用时，进行调度。\n分区集群\n如果集群因网络故障而分区，则 master LIM 会接管分区的每一侧，而候选主节点则在分区的每一侧都可用。 当每个主机仍然可以访问 LSF 可执行文件时，交互式负载共享仍然可用。.\n分区网络\n如果对网络进行了分区，则只有一个分区可以访问 lsb.events 文件，因此 LSF 服务仅在分区的一侧可用。一个锁定文件，用于确保集群中仅运行一个 mbatchd 守护程序。\n作业异常处理\n您可以配置主机和队列，以便 LSF 在作业运行时检测到异常情况，并自动采取适当的措施。 您可以自定义检测到哪些异常以及相应的操作。 例如，您可以将 LSF 设置为在作业退出并显示特定错误代码时，自动重新启动。 \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-10

EGO manages the supply of resources, making them available to applications.\nHosts can be divided into two groups: management hosts and compute hosts. Management hosts provide specialized services to the cluster, while compute hosts run user workload.\nManagement hosts\nManagement hosts provide both cluster and workload management services within the cluster, and are not expected to run workload for users. The master host, all master candidate hosts, and session manager hosts must be management hosts. Other management hosts include the host running the data loaders and data purger for the reporting feature.\nManagement hosts all run on the same operating system: all Windows, all UNIX, or all Linux.\n\nMaster host\nThe master host is the first host installed in the cluster. The resource manager (vemkd) for the cluster resides on this host. The master host controls the rest of the hosts in the cluster and is the interface to the clients of the cluster.\n\nMaster candidates\nThere is only one master host at a time. If the master host should fail, another host automatically takes over the master host role. Hosts that can act as the master are called master candidates.\n\nSession manager host\nOne or more management hosts run session managers. There is one session manager per available slot on a management host. There is one session manager per application.\n\n\nCompute hosts\nCompute hosts are those hosts in the cluster that provide computing resources to consumers. A cluster may contain any number of compute hosts, but must have at least one compute host.\n\nCPU slots\nA CPU slot is the unit used to measure compute resources. A single CPU slot can run one service instance on a compute host, or one session manager on a management host.\n\n\nDaemons\n\nvemkd\nThe VEM kernel daemon that runs on the master host.

For example, a compute host has the attributes of memory, CPU utilization, operating system type.\nResource groups\nResources can be grouped into logical groups to simplify identification, resource allocation, or for administration and monitoring purposes. These resource groups are used to provide a consumer with a like group of hosts to run workload. Any host in a resource group can be able to run the same workload.\nThe following figure shows two resource groups:\n\nManagementHosts\nComputeHosts\n\n\nIf all of your hosts are identical, these resource groups might suffice.

Resources might come and go from the system, so EGO supports dynamic membership in a resource group. Hosts can be placed explicitly into individual resource groups, or the resource groups can be defined with a dynamic membership based on specific criteria.

Multiprocessor hosts are used to run parallel jobs. A multiprocessor host with a single process queue is considered a single machine. A box full of processors that each have their own process queue is treated as a group of separate machines.\nTip\nThe names of your hosts should be unique. They cannot be the same as the cluster name or any queue that is defined for the cluster.\nJob\nAn LSF job is a unit of work that runs in the LSF system.\nA job is a command that is submitted to LSF for execution, by using the bsub command. LSF schedules, controls, and tracks the job according to configured policies.\nJobs can be complex problems, simulation scenarios, extensive calculations, anything that needs compute power.\nJob files\nWhen a job is submitted to a queue, LSF holds it in a job file until conditions are right for it run. Then, the job file is used to run the job.\nOn UNIX, the job file is a Bourne shell script that is run at execution time.\nOn Windows, the job file is a batch file that is processed at execution time.\nInteractive batch job\nAn interactive batch job is a batch job that allows you to interact with the application and still take advantage of LSFscheduling policies and fault tolerance.\nAll input and output are through the terminal that you used to type the job submission command.\nWhen you submit an interactive job, a message is displayed while the job is awaiting scheduling. A new job cannot be submitted until the interactive job is completed or terminated.\nInteractive task\nAn interactive task is a command that is not submitted to a batch queue and scheduled by LSF, but is dispatched immediately.\nLSF locates the resources that are needed by the task and chooses the best host among the candidate hosts that has the required resources and is lightly loaded. Each command can be a single process, or it can be a group of cooperating processes.\nTasks are run without using the batch processing features of LSF but still with the advantage of resource requirements and selection of the best host to run the task based on load.\nLocal task\nA local task is an application or command that does not make sense to run remotely.\nFor example, the ls command on UNIX.\nRemote task\nA remote task is an application or command that that can be run on another machine in the cluster.\nHost types and host models\nHosts in LSF are characterized by host type and host model.\nThe following example is a host with type X86_64, with host models Opteron240, Opteron840, Intel_EM64T, and so on.\n\nHost type\nAn LSF host type is the combination of operating system and host CPU architecture.\nAll computers that run the same operating system on the same computer architecture are of the same type. These hosts are binary-compatible with each other.\nEach host type usually requires a different set of LSF binary files.\nHost model\nAn LSF host model is the host type of the computer, which determines the CPU speed scaling factor that is applied in load and placement calculations.\nThe CPU factor is considered when jobs are being dispatched.\nResources\nLSF resources are objects in the LSF system resources that LSF uses track job requirements and schedule jobs according to their availability on individual hosts.\nResource usage\nThe LSF system uses built-in and configured resources to track resource availability and usage. Jobs are scheduled according to the resources available on individual hosts.\nJobs that are submitted through the LSF system will have the resources that they use monitored while they are running. This information is used to enforce resource limits and load thresholds as well as fairshare scheduling.\nLSF collects the following kinds of information:\n\nTotal CPU time that is consumed by all processes in the job\nTotal resident memory usage in KB of all currently running processes in a job\nTotal virtual memory usage in KB of all currently running processes in a job\nCurrently active process group ID in a job\nCurrently active processes in a job\n\nOn UNIX and Linux, job-level resource usage is collected through PIM.\nLoad indices\nLoad indices measure the availability of dynamic, non-shared resources on hosts in the cluster. Load indices that are built into the LIM are updated at fixed time intervals.\nExternal load indices\nDefined and configured by the LSF administrator and collected by an External Load Information Manager (ELIM) program. The ELIM also updates LIM when new values are received.\nStatic resources\nBuilt-in resources that represent host information that does not change over time, such as the maximum RAM available to user processes or the number of processors in a machine. Most static resources are determined by the LIM at start-up time.\nStatic resources can be used to select appropriate hosts for particular jobs that are based on binary architecture, relative CPU speed, and system configuration.\nLoad thresholds\nTwo types of load thresholds can be configured by your LSF administrator to schedule jobs in queues. Each load threshold specifies a load index value:\n\nThe loadSched load threshold determines the load condition for dispatching pending jobs. If a host’s load is beyond any defined loadSched, a job cannot be started on the host. This threshold is also used as the condition for resuming suspended jobs.\nThe loadStop load threshold determines when running jobs can be suspended.\n\nTo schedule a job on a host, the load levels on that host must satisfy both the thresholds that are configured for that host and the thresholds for the queue from which the job is being dispatched.\nThe value of a load index might either increase or decrease with load, depending on the meaning of the specific load index. Therefore, when you compare the host load conditions with the threshold values, you need to use either greater than (>) or less than (\nRuntime resource usage limits\nLimit the use of resources while a job is running. Jobs that consume more than the specified amount of a resource are signaled.\nHard and soft limits\nResource limits that are specified at the queue level are hard limits while limits that are specified with job submission are soft limits. See the setrlimit man page for information about hard and soft limits.\nResource allocation limits\nRestrict the amount of a resource that must be available during job scheduling for different classes of jobs to start, and which resource consumers the limits apply to. If all of the resource is consumed, no more jobs can be started until some of the resource is released.\nResource requirements (bsub -R)\nThe bsub -R option specifies resources requirements for the job. Resource requirements restrict which hosts the job can run on. Hosts that match the resource requirements are the candidate hosts. When LSF schedules a job, it collects the load index values of all the candidate hosts and compares them to the scheduling conditions. Jobs are only dispatched to a host if all load values are within the scheduling thresholds. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-08 09:01:31\n"},"chapter4/section1/cluster_characteristics.html":{"url":"chapter4/section1/cluster_characteristics.html","title":"集群特征","keywords":"","body":"集群特征\nFind the name of your cluster after installation, cluster administrators, and where hosts are defined.\nCluster name and administrators\nYour cluster is installed according to the installation options specified by the lsfinstall -f install.config command and the options you chose in the install.config file.

Using %J helps you find job output when you run a lot of jobs.\nInteractive batch jobs with bsub -I\nTo submit an interactive job through LSF, use the -I option:\nThe following command submits a batch interactive job that displays the output of the ls command:\n% bsub -I ls\nTo submit a batch interactive job by using a pseudo-terminal, use the bsub -Ip option.\nTo submit a batch interactive job and create a pseudo-terminal with shell mode support, use the bsub -Is option. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 21:31:55\n"},"chapter4/section2/subsection3/Display job status.html":{"url":"chapter4/section2/subsection3/Display job status.html","title":"Display job status","keywords":"","body":"Display job status\nUse the bjobs command to see the job ID and other information about your jobs.\nThe status of each LSF job is updated periodically.\n% bjobs\nJOBID USER      STAT  QUEUE     FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME    SUBMIT_TIME\n1266  user1     RUN   normal    hosta       hostb       sleep 60    Jun 5 17:39:58\nThe job that is named sleep 60 runs for 60 seconds.

A wrapper script is an executable file for launching your application through LSF. It gives users a simple interface to run their jobs that is easy to deploy and maintain.\nFor example, if your application is called abc, rename abc to abc_real and create a wrapper script that is called abc:\n#! /bin/sh\nbsub -R \"rusage[abc_license=1:duration=1]\" abc_real\nWhen users run abc, they are actually running a script to submit a job abc_real to LSF that uses 1 shared resource named abc_license.\nFor more information about specifying shared resources by using the resource requirement (rusage) string on the -R option of the bsub command, see Manage software licenses and other shared resources.\nBy adding appropriate options to the script, you can enhance your integration:\n\nRequeue jobs based on license availability\nCopy input and output files to and from the local directory on the execution host\nCalculate and estimate resource requirements\n\nWrapper binary programs\nA wrapper binary is similar to a wrapper shell script in the form of a compiled binary executable. Compiled wrapper files usually run faster and more efficiently than shell scripts, and they also have access to the LSF API (LSLIB and LSBLIB). Binary code is also more secure because users cannot modify it without the source code and appropriate libraries, but it is more time consuming to develop wrapper binary programs than wrapper shell scripts.\nModifying existing application source code and interfaces\nLSF is already integrated closely with many commonly used software products. IBM and other software application vendors provide facilities and services for closer integration of LSF and other applications. By modifying existing application user interfaces, you can enable easy job submission, license maximization, parallel execution, and other advanced LSF features. In some cases, you are able to run an LSF job directly from the application user interface.\nWhere to go next\nLearn more about administering your cluster, described in Manage users, hosts, and queues. \n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 21:32:42\n"},"chapter4/section2/subsection4/manage_users_hosts_and_queues.html":{"url":"chapter4/section2/subsection4/manage_users_hosts_and_queues.html","title":"管理用户、节点与队列","keywords":"","body":"管理用户、节点与队列\nMake your cluster available to users with cshrc.lsf and profile.lsf.

LSF manages shared resources for host selection and batch or interactive job execution. These resources are dynamic resources because the load on the system changes with the availability of the resources.\nSoftware licenses as shared resources\nThe most common application of shared resources is to manage software application licenses. You submit jobs that require those licenses and LSF runs the jobs according to their priorities when licenses are available. When licenses are not available, LSF queues the jobs then dispatches them when licenses are free. Configuring application licenses as shared resources ensures optimal use of costly and critical resources.\nDefine dynamic shared resources in an ELIM\nFor LSF to use a shared resource like a software license, you must define the resource in the Resource section of the lsf.shared file. You define the type of resource and how often you want LSF to refresh the value of the resource.\nFor LSF to track the resources correctly over time, you must define them as external load indexes. LSF updates load indexes periodically with a program called an External Load Information Manager (ELIM).\nAn ELIM can be a shell script or a compiled binary program, which returns the values of the shared resources you define. The ELIM must be named elim and located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory:\n/usr/share/lsf/lsf/cluser1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/elim\nYou can find examples of sample ELIMs in the misc/examples directory.\nExample of shared licenses\nIn the lsf.shared file, define two dynamic shared resources for software licenses, named license1 and license2:\nBegin Resource\nRESOURCENAME  TYPE    INTERVAL INCREASING  RELEASE   DESCRIPTION   # Keywords\nlicense1      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license1 resource)\nlicense2      Numeric 30       N           Y         (license2 resource)\nEnd Resource\n\nThe\n\n  TYPE\n  parameter for a shared resource can be one of the following types:\n\nNumeric\nBoolean\nString\nIn this case, the resource is Numeric.\n\n\n\nThe INTERVAL parameter specifies how often you want the value to be refreshed. In this example, the ELIM updates the value of the shared resources license1 and license2 every 30 seconds.\n\nThe N in the INCREASING column means that the license resources are decreasing; that is, as more licenses become available, the load becomes lower.\n\nThe Y in the RELEASE column means that the license resources are released when a job that uses the license is suspended.\n\n\nMap dynamic shared resources to hosts\nTo make LSF aware of where the defined dynamic shared resources license1 and license2 you defined, map them to the hosts where they are located.\nIn the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.cluster.cluster_name file, configure a ResourceMap section to specify the mapping between shared resources license1 and license2 you defined in the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.shared file, and the hosts you want to map them to:\nBegin ResourceMap\nRESOURCENAME  LOCATION\nlicense1      [all]\nlicense1      [all]\nEnd ResourceMap\nIn this resource map, the [all] attribute under the LOCATION parameter means that resources license1 and license2 under the RESOURCENAME parameter are available on all hosts in the cluster. Only one ELIM needs to run on the master host because the two resources are the same for all hosts. If the location of the resources is different on different hosts, a different ELIM must run on every host.\nMonitor dynamic shared resources\nFor LSF to receive external load indexes correctly, the ELIM must send a count of the available resources to standard output in the following format:\nnumber_indexes [index_name index_value] ...\nThe fields in this example contain the following information:\n2 license1 3 license2 2\n\nThe total number of external load indexes (2)\nThe name of the first external load index (license1)\nThe value of the first load index (3)\nThe name of the second external load index (license2)\nThe value of the second load index (2)\n\nWrite the ELIM program\nThe ELIM must be an executable program, named elim, located in the LSF_SERVERDIR directory.\nWhen the lim daemon is started or restarted, it runs the elim program on the same host and takes the standard output of the external load indexes that are sent by the elim program. In general, you can define any quantifiable resource as an external load index, write an ELIM to report its value, and use it as an LSF resource.\nThe following example ELIM program uses license1 and license2 and assumes that the FLEXlm license server controls them:\n#!/bin/sh \nNUMLIC=2           # number of dynamic shared resources\nwhile true\ndo\nTMPLICS='/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol2/etc/lic -c \n/usr/share/lsf/cluster1/conf/license.dat -f license1, license2'\n\nLICS='echo $TMPLICS | sed -e s/-/_/g'\necho $NUMLIC $LICS # $NUMLIC is number of dynamic shared \nresource\nsleep 30           # Resource\ndone\nIn the script, the sed command changes the minus sign (-) to underscore (_) in the license feature names because LSF uses the minus sign for calculation, and it is not allowed in resource names.\nThe lic utility is available from IBM Support. You can also use the FLEXlm command lmstat to make your own ELIM.\nUse the dynamic shared resources\nTo enable the new shared resources in your cluster, restart LSF with the following commands:\n\nlsadmin reconfig\nbadmin reconfig\n\nIf no errors are found, use the lsload -l command to verify the value of your dynamic shared resources:\nHOST_NAME  status r15s  r1m  r15m  ut   pg   io  ls  it  tmp  swp  mem license1 license2\nhosta          ok  0.1  0.3  0.4   8%   0.2  50  73   0  62M  700M 425M       3        0 \nhostb          ok  0.1  0.1  0.4   4%   5.7   3   3   0  79M  204M  64M       3        0\nSubmit jobs that use shared resources\nTo submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource, use the command following command:\n% bsub -R 'rusage[license1=1:duration=1]' myjob\nIn the resource requirement (rusage) string, duration=1 means that license1 is reserved for 1 minute to give LSF time to check it out from FLEXlm.\nYou can also specify the resource requirement string at queue level, in the RES_REQ parameter for the queue. In the LSB_CONFDIR/cluster_name/configdir/lsb.queues file, specify the following resource requirement string:\nBegin Queue\nQUEUE_NAME = license1\nRES_REQ=rusage[license1=1:duration=1]\n...\nEnd Queue\nThen, submit a batch job that uses one license1 resource by using the following command:\n% bsub -q license1 myjob\nWhen licenses are available, LSF runs your jobs right away; when all licenses are in use, LSF puts your job in a queue and dispatches them as licenses become available. This way, all of your licenses are used to the best advantage.\nFor more information\n\nFor more information about the lsf.shared and lsf.cluster.cluster_name files and the parameters for configuring shared resources, see the Configuration Reference.\nFor more information about adding external resources to your cluster and configuring an ELIM to customize resources, see External load indices in Administering IBM Spectrum LSF. \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-06 21:35:50\n"},"chapter4/section3/troubleshooting_LSF_problems.html":{"url":"chapter4/section3/troubleshooting_LSF_problems.html","title":"4.3 LSF 排错","keywords":"","body":"4.3 LSF 排错\nTroubleshoot common LSF problems and understand LSF error messages.

LSF logs errors to the following files:\n\nlim.log.host_name\nres.log.host_name\npim.log.host_name\nmbatchd.log.master_host\nmbschd.log.master_host\nsbatchd.log.host_name\nvemkd.log.master_host\n\nIf these log files contain any error messages that you do not understand, contact IBM Support.\nDiagnosing and fixing most LSF problems\nGeneral troubleshooting steps for most LSF problems.\nProcedure\n\nRun the lsadmin ckconfig -v command and note any errors that are shown in the command output.\nLook for the error in one of the problems described in this section. If none of these troubleshooting steps applies to your situation, contact IBM Support.\n\nUse the following commands to restart the LSF cluster:\n# lsadmin limrestart all\n# lsadmin resrestart all\n# badmin hrestart all\n\nRun the ps -ef command to see whether the LSF daemons are running.\nLook for the processes similar to the following command output:\nroot 17426     1  0   13:30:40 ?    0:00 /opt/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/etc/lim\nroot 17436     1  0   13:31:11 ?    0:00 /opt/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/etc/sbatchd\nroot 17429     1  0   13:30:56 ?    0:00 /opt/lsf/cluster1/10.1/sparc-sol10/etc/res\n\nCheck the LSF error logs on the first few hosts that are listed in the Host section of the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.cluster.cluster_name file.\nIf the LSF_MASTER_LIST parameter is defined in the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf file, check the error logs on the hosts that are listed in this parameter instead.\n\n\nCannot open lsf.conf file\nYou might see this message when you run the lsid file. The message usually means that the LSF_CONFDIR/lsf.conf file is not accessible to LSF.\nAbout this task\nBy default, LSF checks the directory that is defined by the LSF_ENVDIR parameter for the lsf.conf file. If the lsf.conf file is not in LSF_ENVDIR, LSF looks for it in the /etc directory.\nFor more information, see Setting up the LSF environment with cshrc.lsf and profile.lsf.\nProcedure\n\nMake sure that a symbolic link exists from /etc/lsf.conf to lsf.conf\nUse the csrhc.lsf or profile.lsf script to set up your LSF environment.\nMake sure that the cshrc.lsf or profile.lsf script is available for users to set the LSF environment variables.\n\nLIM dies quietly\nWhen the LSF LIM daemon exits unexpectedly, check for errors in the LIM configuration files.\nProcedure\nRun the following commands:\nlsadmin ckconfig -v\nThis command displays most configuration errors. If the command does not report any errors, check in the LIM error log.\nLIM communication times out\nSometimes the LIM is up, but running the lsload command prints the following error message:Communication time out.\nAbout this task\nIf the LIM just started, LIM needs time to get initialized by reading configuration files and contacting other LIMs. If the LIM does not become available within one or two minutes, check the LIM error log for the host you are working on.\nTo prevent communication timeouts when the local LIM is starting or restarting, define the parameter LSF_SERVER_HOSTS in the lsf.conf file. The client contacts the LIM on one of the LSF_SERVER_HOSTS and runs the command. At least one of the hosts that are defined in the list must have a LIM that is up and running.\nWhen the local LIM is running but the cluster has no master, LSF applications display the following message:\nCannot locate master LIM now, try later.\nProcedure\nCheck the LIM error logs on the first few hosts that are listed in the Host section of the lsf.cluster.cluster_name file. If the LSF_MASTER_LIST parameter is defined in the lsf.conf file, check the LIM error logs on the hosts that are listed in this parameter instead.\nMaster LIM is down\nSometimes the master LIM is up, but running the lsload or lshosts command displays the following error message: Master LIM is down; try later.\nAbout this task\nIf the /etc/hosts file on the host where the master LIM is running is configured with the host name that is assigned to the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1), LSF client LIMs cannot contact the master LIM. When the master LIM starts up, it sets its official host name and IP address to the loopback address. Any client requests get the master LIM address as 127.0.0.1, and try to connect to it, and in fact tries to access itself.\nProcedure\nCheck the IP configuration of your master LIM in /etc/hosts.\nThe following example incorrectly sets the master LIM IP address to the loopback address:\n127.0.0.1   localhost   myhostname\nThe following example correctly sets the master LIM IP address:\n127.0.0.1    localhost\n192.168.123.123   myhostname\nFor a master LIM running on a host that uses an IPv6 address, the loopback address is\n::1\nThe following example correctly sets the master LIM IP address by using an IPv6 address:\n::1    localhost ipv6-localhost ipv6-loopback \n\nfe00::0     ipv6-localnet \n\nff00::0     ipv6-mcastprefix\nff02::1     ipv6-allnodes\nff02::2     ipv6-allrouters\nff02::3     ipv6-allhosts\nUser permission denied\nIf the remote host cannot securely determine the user ID of the user that is requesting remote execution, remote execution fails with the following error message: User permission denied..\nProcedure\n\nCheck the RES error log on the remote host for more detailed error message.\n\nIf you do not want to configure an identification daemon (LSF_AUTH in lsf.conf), all applications that do remote executions must be owned by root with the setuid bit set. Run the following command:\nchmod 4755 filename\n\nIf the application binary files are on an NFS-mounted file system, make sure that the file system is not mounted with the nosuid flag.\n\nIf you are using an identification daemon (the LSF_AUTH parameter in the lsf.conf file), the inetd daemon must be configured. The identification daemon must not be run directly.\n\nInconsistent host names in a name server with /etc/hosts and /etc/hosts.equiv can also cause this problem. If the LSF_USE_HOSTEQUIV parameter is defined in the lsf.conf file, check that the /etc/hosts.equiv file or the HOME/.rhosts file on the destination host has the client host name in it.\n\nFor Windows hosts, users must register and update their Windows passwords by using the lspasswd command. Passwords must be 3 characters or longer, and 31 characters or less.\nFor Windows password authentication in a non-shared file system environment, you must define the parameter LSF_MASTER_LIST in the lsf.conf file so that jobs run with correct permissions. If you do not define this parameter, LSF assumes that the cluster uses a shared file system environment.\n\n\nRemote execution fails because of non-uniform file name space\nA non-uniform file name space might cause a command to fail with the following error message: chdir(...) failed: no such file or directory.\nAbout this task\nYou are trying to run a command remotely, but either your current working directory does not exist on the remote host, or your current working directory is mapped to a different name on the remote host.\nIf your current working directory does not exist on a remote host, do not run commands remotely on that host.\nProcedure\n\nIf the directory exists, but is mapped to a different name on the remote host, you must create symbolic links to make them consistent.\n\nLSF can resolve most, but not all, problems by using automount. The automount maps must be managed through NIS.\nContact IBM Support if you are running automount and LSF is not able to locate directories on remote hosts.\n\n\nBatch daemons die quietly\nWhen the LSF batch daemons sbatchd and mbatchd exit unexpectedly, check for errors in the configuration files.\nAbout this task\nIf the mbatchd daemon is running but the sbatchd daemon dies on some hosts, it might be because mbatchd is not configured to use those hosts.\nProcedure\n\nCheck the sbatchd and mbatchd daemon error logs.\nRun the badmin ckconfig command to check the configuration.\nCheck for email in the LSF administrator mailbox.\n\nsbatchd starts but mbatchd does not\nWhen the sbatchd daemon starts but the mbatchd daemon is not running, it is possible that mbatchd is temporarily unavailable because the master LIM is temporarily unknown. The following error message is displayed: sbatchd: unknown service.\nProcedure\n\nRun the lsid command to check whether LIM is running.\nIf LIM is not running properly, follow the steps in the following topics to fix LIM problems:\n\nLIM dies quietly\nLIM communication times out\nMaster LIM is down\n\n\nCheck whether services are registered properly.\n\n\nAvoiding orphaned job processes\nLSF uses process groups to track all the processes of a job. However, if the application forks a child, the child becomes a new process group. The parent dies immediately, and the child process group is orphaned from the parent process, and cannot be tracked.\nAbout this task\nFor more information about process tracking with Linux cgroups, see Memory and swap limit enforcement based on Linux cgroup memory subsystem.\nProcedure\n\nWhen a job is started, the application runs under the job RES or root process group.\n\nIf an application creates a new process group, and its parent process ID (PPID) still belongs to the job, PIM can track this new process group as part of the job.\nThe only reliable way to not lose track of a process is to prevent it from using a new process group. Any process that daemonizes itself is lost when child processes are orphaned from the parent process group because it changes its process group right after it is detached.\n\n\nHost not used by LSF\nThe mbatchd daemon allows the sbatchd daemon to run only on the hosts that are listed in the Host section of the lsb.hosts file. If you configure an unknown host in the following configurations, mbatchd logs an error message: HostGroup or HostPartition sections of the lsb.hosts file, or as a HOSTS definition for a queue in the lsb.queues file.\nAbout this task\nIf you try to configure a host that is not listed in the Host section of the lsb.hosts file, the mbatchd daemon logs the following message.\nmbatchd on host: LSB_CONFDIR/cluster1/configdir/file(line #): Host hostname is not used by lsbatch; ignored\nIf you start the sbatchd daemon on a host that is not known by the mbatchd daemon, mbatchd rejects the sbatchd. The sbatchd daemon logs the following message and exits.\nThis host is not used by lsbatch system.\nProcedure\n\nAdd the unknown host to the list of hosts in the Host section of the lsb.hosts file.\n\nStart the LSF daemons on the new host.\n\nRun the following commands to reconfigure the cluster:\nlsadmin reconfig\nbadmin reconfig\n\n\nUNKNOWN host type or model\nA model or type UNKNOWN indicates that the host is down or the LIM on the host is down. You need to take immediate action to restart LIM on the UNKNOWN host.\nProcedure\n\nStart the host.\n\nRun the lshosts command to see which host has the UNKNOWN host type or model.\nlshosts\nHOST_NAME  type       model   cpuf   ncpus  maxmem   maxswp  server   RESOURCES \nhostA   UNKNOWN      Ultra2   20.2       2    256M    710M      Yes   ()\n\nRun the lsadmin limstartup command to start LIM on the host.\nlsadmin limstartup hostA\nStarting up LIM on  .... done\nIf EGO is enabled in the LSF cluster, you can run the following command instead:\negosh ego start lim hostA\nStarting up LIM on  .... done\nYou can specify more than one host name to start LIM on multiple hosts. If you do not specify a host name, LIM is started on the host from which the command is submitted.\nTo start LIM remotely on UNIX or Linux, you must be root or listed in the lsf.sudoers file (or the ego.sudoers file if EGO is enabled in the LSF cluster). You must be able to run the rsh command across all hosts without entering a password.\n\nWait a few seconds, then run the lshosts command again.\nThe lshosts command displays a specific model or type for the host or DEFAULT. If you see DEFAULT, it means that automatic detection of host type or model failed, and the host type that is configured in the lsf.shared file cannot be found. LSF works on the host, but a DEFAULT model might be inefficient because of incorrect CPU factors. A DEFAULT type might also cause binary incompatibility because a job from a DEFAULT host type can be migrated to another DEFAULT host type.\n\n\nDEFAULT host type or model\nIf you see DEFAULT in lim -t, it means that automatic detection of host type or model failed, and the host type that is configured in the lsf.shared file cannot be found. LSF works on the host, but a DEFAULT model might be inefficient because of incorrect CPU factors. A DEFAULT type might also cause binary incompatibility because a job from a DEFAULT host type can be migrated to another DEFAULT host type.\nProcedure\n\nRun the lshosts command to see which host has the DEFAULT host model or type.\nlshosts\nHOST_NAME     type    model     cpuf   ncpus  maxmem  maxswp   server  RESOURCES \nhostA     DEFAULT  DEFAULT        1       2    256M   710M       Yes  ()\nIf Model or Type are displayed as DEFAULT when you use the lshosts command and automatic host model and type detection is enabled, you can leave it as is or change it.\nIf the host model is DEFAULT, LSF works correctly but the host has a CPU factor of 1, which might not make efficient use of the host model.\nIf the host type is DEFAULT, there might be binary incompatibility. For example, if one host is Linux and another is AIX, but both hosts are set to type DEFAULT, jobs that are running on the Linux host might be migrated to the AIX host and vice versa, which might cause the job to file.\n\nRun lim -t on the host whose type is DEFAULT:\nlim -t\nHost Type             : NTX64\nHost Architecture     : EM64T_1596\nTotal NUMA Nodes      : 1\nTotal Processors      : 2\nTotal Cores           : 4\nTotal Threads         : 2\nMatched Type          : NTX64\nMatched Architecture  : EM64T_3000\nMatched Model         : Intel_EM64T\nCPU Factor            : 60.0\nNoteThe value of HostType and Host Architecture.\n\nEdit the lsf.shared file to configure the host type and host model for the host.\n\nIn the HostType section, enter a new host type. Use the host type name that is detected with the lim -t command.\nBegin HostType\nTYPENAME \nDEFAULT \nCRAYJ\nNTX64\n...\nEnd HostType\n\nIn the HostModel section, enter the new host model with architecture and CPU factor. Use the architecture that is detected with the lim -t commmand. Add the host model to the end of the host model list. The limit for host model entries is 127. Lines commented out with # are not counted in the 127-line limit.\nBegin HostModel\nMODELNAME   CPUFACTOR     ARCHITECTURE # keyword\nIntel_EM64T      20             EM64T_1596\nEnd HostModel\n\n\n\nSave changes to the lsf.shared file.\n\nRun the lsadmin reconfig command to reconfigure LIM.\n\nWait a few seconds, and run the lim -t command again to check the type and model of the host. \n\n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-09 12:01:19\n"},"chapter4/section3/LSF_error_messages.html":{"url":"chapter4/section3/LSF_error_messages.html","title":"LSF 错误信息","keywords":"","body":"LSF 错误信息\nThe following error messages are logged by the LSF daemons, or displayed by the lsadmin ckconfig and badmin ckconfig commands.\nGeneral errors\nThe following messages can be generated by any LSF daemon:\n\ncan’t open file: error\nThe daemon might not open the named file for the reason that is given by error.

Jobs are only dispatched to a host if all load values are within the scheduling thresholds.\nCommands\n\nbsub -R — Specify resource requirement string for a job\n\nConfiguration\n\nlsb.queues — Configure resource requirements for queues \n\n© 2020 小白大侠 all right reserved，powered by Gitbook本文修订于：\n2020-07-08 09:29:02\n"},"chapter5/section1/Job_lifecycle.html":{"url":"chapter5/section1/Job_lifecycle.html","title":"Job lifecycle","keywords":"","body":"Job lifecycle\n\nParent topic:\nAbout IBM Spectrum LSF\n1 Submit a job\nYou submit a job from an LSF client or server with the bsub command.\nIf you do not specify a queue when submitting the job, the job is submitted to the default queue.\nJobs are held in a queue waiting to be scheduled and have the PEND state. The job is held in a job file in the LSF_SHAREDIR/cluster_name/logdir/info/ directory.\nJob ID\nLSF assigns each job a unique job ID when you submit the job.\nJob name\nYou can also assign a name to the job with the -J option of bsub. Unlike the job ID, the job name is not necessarily unique.\n2 Schedule job\n\nmbatchd looks at jobs in the queue and sends the jobs for scheduling to mbschd at a preset time interval (defined by the parameter JOB_SCHEDULING_INTERVAL in lsb.params).\nmbschd evaluates jobs and makes scheduling decisions based on the following:\nJob priority\nScheduling policies\nAvailable resources\n\n\nmbschd selects the best hosts where the job can run and sends its decisions back to mbatchd.\n\nResource information is collected at preset time intervals by the master LIM from LIMs on server hosts. The master LIM communicates this information to mbatchd, which in turn communicates it to mbschd to support scheduling decisions.\n3 Dispatch job\nAs soon as mbatchd receives scheduling decisions, it immediately dispatches the jobs to hosts.\n4 Run job\nsbatchd handles job execution. It does the following:\n\nReceives the request from mbatchd\nCreates a child sbatchd for the job\nCreates the execution environment\nStarts the job using res\n\nThe execution environment is copied from the submission host to the execution host and includes the following:\n\nEnvironment variables that are needed by the job\n\nWorking directory where the job begins running\n\nOther system-dependent environment settings; for example:\n\nOn UNIX and Linux, resource limits and umask\n\nOn Windows, desktop and Windows root directory\nThe job runs under the user account that submitted the job and has the status RUN.\n\n\n\n\n5 Return output\nWhen a job is completed, it is assigned the DONE status if the job was completed without any problems. The job is assigned the EXIT status if errors prevented the job from completing.\nsbatchd communicates job information including errors and output to mbatchd.\n6 Send email to client\nmbatchd returns the job output, job error, and job information to the submission host through email. Use the -o and -e options of bsub to send job output and errors to a file.\nJob report\nA job report is sent by email to the LSF client and includes the following information:\n\nJob information such
