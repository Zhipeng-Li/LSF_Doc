Get an overview of your cluster and the location of important LSF directories and configuration files.

**[LSF Terms and Concepts](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_admin/terms.html?view=kc)**
Before you use LSF for the first time, you should read the *LSF Foundations Guide* for a basic understanding of workload management and job submission, and the *Administrator Foundations Guide* for an overview of cluster management and operations.**[Cluster characteristics](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_admin_foundations/cluster_characteristics.html?view=kc)**
Find the name of your cluster after installation, cluster administrators, and where hosts are defined.**[File systems, directories, and files](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_admin/file_systems_lsf.html?view=kc)**
LSF is designed for networks where all hosts have shared file systems, and files have the same names on all hosts.**[Important directories and configuration files](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_admin_foundations/cluster_dirs_files.html?view=kc)**
LSF configuration is administered through several configuration files, which you use to modify the behavior of your cluster.
