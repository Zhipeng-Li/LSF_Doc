- **Start, stop, and reconfigure LSF**
  Use LSF administration commands **lsadmin** and **badmin** to start and stop LSF daemons, and reconfigure cluster properties.

  Use LSF administration commands to check cluster configuration, see cluster status, and LSF batch workload system configuration and status.
- **Run LSF jobs**
  Use the **bsub** and **lsrun** commands to run jobs through LSF. Use the **bjobs** command to see the status of your jobs. Control job execution with the **bstop**, **bresume**, and **bkill** commands.
- **Manage users, hosts, and queues**
  Make your cluster available to users with cshrc.lsf and profile.lsf. Add or remove hosts and queues from your cluster.
