# About viewing available licenses

The license server collects license feature information from physical servers and merges this data together into a service domain. After merging the data, the individual license server information is retained and you can view this information together with the physical server information.

The licenses in use are checked out from FlexNet by your projects. Free licenses and licenses that are reserved by a project are not yet checked out from FlexNet.

The total number of licenses could change as licenses expire or are added. As non-LSF users check out licenses, the OTHERS count in **blstat** increases and the TOTAL_FREE count decreases. The number of licenses for each project changes whenever LSF redistributes license tokens among competing projects.
