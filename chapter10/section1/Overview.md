# Overview

Applying policies to how licenses are shared can have significant benefits both in terms of productivity and cost savings.

## Share licenses more easily

IBM Spectrum LSF License Scheduler (LSF License Scheduler) makes it easy to share licenses between project teams and departments within the same design center or around the globe. With tools to allocate and monitor licenses, license owners can share licenses not in use, while still ensuring immediate access to licenses when needed. With more effective sharing, all users perceive a larger pool of licenses.

## Ensure appropriate license allocation

License Scheduler enables flexible, hierarchical sharing policies that reflect the needs of the business. During quiet periods, when licenses are not in contention, licenses can be allocated to anyone who needs them keeping utilization and throughput high. During busy periods, the supply of licenses can be allocated based on policy toward the most time or revenue critical projects.

## Improve service levels and productivity

By ensuring access to a minimum share of licenses and enabling allocation to flex between clusters that are based on need, licenses are more readily available and jobs are less likely to pend in queues that are awaiting license resources. This translates into reduced wait times and better productivity, and contributes to a faster, more efficient design environment.

## Reduce or avoid cost

By being able to allocate scarce licenses to the most critical projects, and by being able to analyze license usage in the context of cluster resources, users and projects, planners are better able to find and remove bottlenecks, making their existing licenses more productive. With better visibility to how licenses are being used, they can plan license requirements more effectively ultimately helping to contain costs and boost productivity.

License Scheduler controls the software license sharing in your organization. License Scheduler works with FlexNet™ and Reprise License Manager™ products to control and monitor license usage.
