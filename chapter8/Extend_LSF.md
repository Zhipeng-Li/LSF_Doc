#  Chapter 8 LSF 拓展

Configure and use IBM Spectrum LSF integrations.

**[IBM Spectrum LSF Session Scheduler](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_ss.html?view=kc)**
Install, manage, and use IBM Spectrum LSF Session Scheduler. Run large collections of short duration tasks within the allocation of a single LSF job by using a job-level task scheduler that allocates resources for the job once, and reuses the allocated resources for each task. IBM Spectrum LSF Session Scheduler is ideal for running short jobs, whether they are a list of tasks, or job arrays with parametric execution.**[IBM Spectrum LSF with IBM Rational ClearCase](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_clearcase.html?view=kc)**
Many sites use the IBM® Rational® ClearCase® (ClearCase) environment for revision source control and development. Learn how to install, configure, and use IBM Spectrum LSF with IBM Rational ClearCase software.**[IBM Spectrum LSF on Cray Linux](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_cray.html?view=kc)**
The IBM Spectrum LSF integration with Cray Linux applies to LSF Version 8.0 or later, and supports integration with Cray Linux Environment 4.0 or later. You must have LSF Standard Edition or LSF Advanced Edition. The Cray Linux integration is not supported on LSF Express Edition.**[IBM Spectrum LSF with Apache Spark](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_spark.html?view=kc)**
Configure and use IBM Spectrum LSF with Apache Spark applications.**[IBM Spectrum LSF with Apache Hadoop](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_hadoop.html?view=kc)**
Configure and use IBM Spectrum LSF with Apache Hadoop applications.**[IBM Spectrum LSF with IBM Cluster Systems Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_csm.html?view=kc)**
IBM Cluster Systems Manager (CSM) is a systems management tool that is designed for simple, low-cost management of distributed and clustered IBM Power Systems. Learn how to install, configure, and use IBM Spectrum LSF with IBM Cluster Systems Manager.**[IBM Spectrum LSF with IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_icp.html?view=kc)**
Variable Use licensing for dynamic compute workloads that extend to the cloud, enables you to optimize cloud-based resource usage with cost-effective pay-as-you-go licensing. Administrators can configure an IBM Spectrum LSF cluster to upload CPU core, CPU socket, GPU socket, and host count through an external load index monitor (ELIM) to a metering service in IBM Cloud Private. Administrators can then audit IBM Spectrum LSF resource usage from the metering dashboard in IBM Cloud Private.**[LSF Job Step Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/jsm/jsm_kickoff.html?view=kc)**
**[Submitting jobs using JSDL](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_admin/appendix_jsdl_lsf_admin.html?view=kc)**
**[IBM Spectrum LSF Simulator](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_welcome/lsf_kc_simulator.html?view=kc)**
Use the LSF Simulator to analyze and tune your LSF configuration by simulating an LSF cluster in a separate, internal environment. LSF Simulator allows you to run experiments with different and workload traces without interrupting the LSF production environment.
